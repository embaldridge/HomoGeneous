#The Long Tails of Lunatics


‘A casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything.’—Friedrich Nietzsche,  


‘What can you do against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?’—George Orwell,  


        Two weeks ago, a man drew a ticket from a ticket station. He took the ticket from the geanie’s mouth and saw that he was to stay the night in a squad bay. This was to be his fourteenth straight night of sleeping in squad bays and he was very nearly sick of it. Board games and story time, storyboards and GameTime, he wanted none of it. Communal showers and bunk beds were certainly better than bunk showers and communal beds, but he was still sick of it. Fifty-nine snoring, boring, yapping, and lightly napping men. One hundred and eighteen men’s feet, and one thousand eight hundred feet of men’s bowels. One night, he could do that; even two and maybe three. Fourteen nights, though, that was asking too much. If it were fourteen nights in an artisan cottage; well, that would have been different.
The chance of this unfortunate series of so-called independent events (1 in every 78,364,164,096 fortnights worth of drawing tickets) was unbelievably low. Well, actually, it was quite believable1. The man felt betrayed by the geanie and if it were not for his non-violent Homo neutralis nature, would have choked the damn thing with its own turban. As it were, the man was not violent and the geanie was robotic; it was however, laughing on the inside at the silly ape’s circumstances. Still, the man was frustrated to the point of collapse, and it would not have been inconceivable for a passerby to see a grown man sitting on the sidewalk, with his shoes in his hands, kicking and screaming at the dismembered torso of a robotic geanie. Instead, the man abandoned his cool Homo neutralis rationale and even his primate instincts to shout and throw feces. He dug deep into the folds of his reptilian basal ganglia and found the proper set of responses to help him cope with this inexplicable injustice; this heavy-handed slap in the face from a robotic ticket station geanie that served some higher malevolent power. The man turned red, extended his dewlap, and executed five jerky push-ups2.


1. Had the man thought about it, he would have realized that the situation that was only incidentally his, was almost inevitable. That is, the population of Bath is about 3,000 H. neutralis and, assuming for math sake, it nearly always has been 3,000 and then realizing that every H. neutralis draws a ticket for a place to sleep every night (not withstanding hospitals stays, campers, and ultra-marathoners) 3,000 fortnights occur every two weeks. That means, in one month there passes 6,000 fortnights. By that rate, it would take about 13,060,694 months or just a little over 1 million years for this event to occur. Assuming that H. neutralis has been ramshaking the house of primate evolution for almost three million years, the event that has the man resorting to aggressive lizard behaviors, should have happened once or twice before, based on chance alone. 
2. Changing colors, extending dewlaps, and executing jerky push-ups are aggressive behaviors displayed by some lizards.
      
        After the man had regained his composure and reset his hyiod bone, he determined that the Universe had ‘gipped’ him. The robotic geanie of the ticket station snickered inwardly as the man imagined the Universe laughing at him. ‘Somewhere, someone is walking through the front door of a cozy apartment, perhaps, for the fourteenth night in a row!’ The man became infuriated at the thought of it. Again, he was mistaken. A double occurrence of this kind of event, even within the same year, astronomically small. No matter though. The Universe, he thought, was clearly laughing at him and not with him. Indeed, if the Universe could laugh with anyone, it would have been laughing with the robotic geanie in the ticket station. In reality, the Universe can neither laugh nor contemplate nor ‘gip’ anybody. In fact, we are far too small for the Universe to even see, if indeed, the Universe had the power of sight. Furthermore, and from the Universe’s perspective, our entire galaxy is increasingly becoming a smaller and all the more insignificant corner cobweb. How arrogant this man must be to think that an expanding Universe has nothing better to do than tie his shoes together. Certainly, the Universe has more pressing matters at hand, like finding a way to stay warm.
        Regardless of whether the Universe was out to get him, the first Homo neutralis in the history felt cheated and had no person in sight to blame for it. Who to blame, then? Now, to jump immediately to presumming a fully fledged God would, for one, be prejudiced against a cornicopia of other Lunacies. After all, a giant turtle upon which the Earth tilts could be playing us like a pin-ball wizard. Additionally, it would be down-right naïve to think any man was capable of taking so many blind leaps all in one go. So no, our proto-idiot, who had never formed a superstitious thought, did not suddenly arrive at fully-winged lunacy as we know it today. Instead he decided that if a curve of normally distributed values looked like a bell, which it does and which is why we refer to it as such, he was surely planted at the far left tail of its tapering rim. That is, he saw himself as having been dealt cards from a deck that was stacked against him by a slick-handed Universe. Besides being the first irrational Homo neutralis in history, he was also terrible at intuiting chance and at remembering the most basic features of probability. Specifically, he failed to recall that even the values at the very rim of the most normal bell curves are the results of an unbiased distribution around a single average. He also failed to realize that the normal distribution did not apply to his problem. Indeed, when asking the chance of a certain number of losses (pulling a ticket that directs you to a squad bay) occurring in a certain number of draws, one would turn to the binomial distribution.
         With confidence in-hand and caution to the wind, the man felt liberated to finally know what probabilities, likelihoods, chances, distributions, and sampling formulas could not tell him. With the damn broken, the waters rushed and the creative juices flowed. He took out his pen and notebook and began scribbling his epiphany. He wrote a poem:


Oh fortune!
You change and shift like the moon
Your phases seem regular
But you hide among the clouds and blind my path at night
You emerge in midmorning to offer your brightness
You wax and you wane
You soothe my pain
And then rip my healing wounds
Detestable, unequittable life!




Fate – monstrous and empty
On your whirling wheel
You spin a golden thread of life
But cut it at your whim
and we fade to nothing
How nice it must be
Veiled in eternity
To plague an insect
and tear off its wings!
 
Fate and Fortune
are my bedfollows
Driven on and weighted down
They stare as I slumber
And even at this late hour
they do not sleep
They pine for my death
To take hold onto a stronger man
Everyone weep with me!


        Unlike the colorful cultures of the imaginative but largely superstitious and warlike Homo sapiens, fortune and fate do not have poetic meanings in the homogeneous culture of the equally imaginative but largely rational and cooperative Homo neutralis. I suppose, that if a person felt that neither good luck nor bad luck, fate, fortune, nor fortune tellers, Manifest Destiny nor plain-old destiny, prophesies, demigods nor full-fledged Gods were on their side nor the side of anyone else, that person might weigh their potential success and that of others with a clearer mind. That person might realize that regardless of whether a black cat crossed their paths or whether the skin on their penises has been lopped off, chances of success are often determined by the strength of numbers and that success itself, when chance plays any part, is never pre-determined.
        In Homo neutralis culture, fortune was merely a chance result that was either favorable or unfavorable. Like the everyday decisions of where to sit and what to eat that are largely inconsequential (unless you have hemorrhoids, diabetes, etc.) and have no foreseeable or proveable moral value, the results of any particular lottery was often of little consequence. Consequently, fortune was very rarely personified as in the disturbed man’s poem. Additionally, in Homo neutralis culture, fate was merely an inevitable and predetermined outcome. For instance, every Homo neutralis was fated to die soon after having sex. Fate, too, was rarely personified. Even to this frustrated Homo neutralis, fortune and fate were merely poetic concepts; simple personifications of compounding misfortunes shovelled-on by the Universe. He, unlike you, had not the benefit of a culture that had evolved the concepts of fate and fortune into racial, political, social, economical, idealogical, and religious rights, prejudices, and motivators. Indeed, if the man were to join Homo sapiens culture, even at the peak of his irrationality, he would be surprised at the level of ours. However, if the Universe was not going to play fair, neither would he. 
The man decided that he would not being staying in a squad bay. No, he took his fortune into his own hands. He tore up his condeming ticket, threw the recyclable pieces into the nearest receptical, and marched-off to go apartment hunting among the nearest set of row houses. ‘Ooh, I’m telling,’ said the geanie. That night, he stayed in swanky apartment meant for two. There was no hokey laughter and offensive odors coming from the fifty-nine mouths and one hundred eighteen feet of an open squad bay. He was alone, wrapped in the warm consolation of his choice to do as he pleased. He sipped mini-marshmallows from a cup of hot chocolate and likened them to a cobblestone road that overlaid a rich and chocolatey lake. ‘Why hasn’t anyone tried this before?’ he said to himself over a package of Happy Old Lady’s Cookies. In truth, the man never quite got how ‘the whole neuter social contract and equalibrarian thingy’ worked. He came to the conclusion that his eyes had been opened to something only he could see.
The man decided that he was special among Homo neutralis, and not just in the way that we are all special either in the divinitive sense or the genetically definitive sense. He decided that he was unique among mankind in that he was the only one of them to devise an alternative to neutrality. To his credit, plenty of people have trouble recognizing that any credible alternatives, or any alternatives at all, lie outside the structures and strictures they have inherited. To his discredit, the man was not certainly not the first to deign an alternative to neutrality. However, this did not stop him from determining that if he merely did whatever he wanted, without regard to the lottery whatsoever, he could make an immense profit. Had he made up for his obvious deficiencies in math and logic with a proficiency in English, he would have called himself The Profit. Instead, the man decided that from that day forward he would be known as, The Prophet. The Prophet wrote:


‘And immediately the scales fell from his eyes and he received a divine sight. He rose and was made anew.’—The Prophet


‘With a slit reptilian eye, the Universe chooses those who rub away the scales of equality from their eyes.’—The Prophet


‘The Universe holds a gun at the starting line and the runners take their stance. The Universe pulls the trigger and begins the race by shooting one of the runners and taking aim at another as the pack bursts forward.’—The Prophet


‘The Universe plays favorites and rolls a loaded die.’ —The Prophet


‘Pure chance is purely an illusion.’ —The Prophet


‘Probability distributions are the inventions of artists with severely limited abilities to draw anything but curvy lines.’ —The Prophet


‘Give me a piece of chalk and I will draw you a bell-curve within a landscape populated by sabre-toothed elephants.’ —The Prophet


‘Frustration is the gift of statisticians 
and unreplicable derivation  
is that of mathematicians
Pulling from marbles from empty jars
I call them all magicians’—The Prophet


‘The Big Bang went off. The Universe had shot my dog.’—The Prophet


‘You are not you. You are your idea of you that you ignore because your thought of you makes you sick. You are a ewe and I am a shepherd.’—The Prophet


‘I live on the tip-tail of a normal dinosaur. It is symmetrical, front to back; its guts hold those who were once in its mouth.’—The Prophet


‘Why would any intelligent being draw a card at random, when it could flip the deck over and pick the one it wanted?’—The Prophet


‘The Universe misunderestimates me.’—The Prophet1


‘I'm The Prophet -- see, I don't need to explain -- I do not need to explain why I say things. That's the interesting thing about being The Prophet.’—The Prophet2

        As the man continued to write, the insanity of his psalms continued to grow. The more unintelligible his prophesies, poems, and proclamations became, the more he grew convinced of this unique ability and insight. Indeed, no person in Bath had the imagination, charisma, eloquance, and utter stupidity that this man had. He named himself, The Prophet. Not just a prophet or even A Prophet, for he was the first and only prophet Bath had ever had. Indeed, just how he arrived at the word prophet is a mystery. The Prophet’s ideas came faster as he thought less, and with attaining a perfect level of non-though, wrote with blinding speeds about everything he didn’t actually know anything about. He filled five notebooks before he fell asleep.
The last sentence on the last page of the fifth notebook read:


“I would have the last laugh, but I will never die, so I can never laugh the last laugh because I can always laugh more, but I can out-laugh the Universe because I can’t die and the Universe never lived; It can’t laugh so I already win. Ego sum abbas*, Ha!”—The Prophet


*The thirteenth carmen, Ego sum abbas—I am the abbot. A wayward Goliard exclaims his position of authority on the Big Rock Candy Mountain, abandoning morality and rationality, he baptizes monks in debauchery and curses Fortune.
