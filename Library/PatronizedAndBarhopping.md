#PatronizedAndBarhopping


‘It’s virtually impossible to reason with Lunatics’ said Piss Drunk, ‘We can get past them though,’ he added, ‘if we barhop.’
‘Barhop!?’ exclaimed Very Confused.
‘Yes, barhop, it’s our only hope. If we travel quickly from pub to pub, we’ll be able to avoid the mobs. They’ve been after me for several days now, but they can’t touch me if I’m in a pub. Public don’t want their drunks being committed as lunatics.’
Very Confused and the bartender then swung their heads to Pissed Drunk ‘After you? What for?’ asked the bartender.
‘This,’ said Pissed Drunk, pointing to the backpack.
‘This backpack contains everything you’d need to find and release the loonies.’
‘Escaped, what do you mean escaped?’ asked Very Confused.
‘They trapped me in an alley and forced me to take a sobriety test,’ replied Piss Drunk.
‘I failed the breathalizer,’ he said. 


‘They knew I was sober. So, they carried me off to what they called The White House. I can still hear’em sayin’, “Sober people are starvin’ sheep, and we have a shepherd for you.” T’was the creepiest thing I ever heard. They tossed me in a room that was plastered with loonie propaganda. Sayin’s like “The Universe is a Single verse, but you are a poem.” , “Do what you will and the will that you do will become what you’re due, won’t it?” , “Chance are, a probability of having a favorable likelihood, probably results from double-dipping.” They played songs about liberatin’ yerself from thinking too hard and would send in babes that were but four days old to witness to me about the Universe, fate, and fortune. They called’em elders, and them elders were still in their cannibalistic phase. You can imagine what I went through in that place!’ 


‘Well, how did you escape?’ asked Very Confused.
‘Actually, it was easy. I just said that Universe told me to pee on myself,’ replied Piss Drunk. ‘They got all disgusted and tossed me out. But not before I swiped one o’the backpacks off’er their bicycles.’
The bartender cut in.
‘That’s why you’ll have ta barhop, lads’ he said. ‘You’ll have to make sure ya stay pissed, least while yer outside. Ya don’t want to fail that damn breathalizer; when they come up on ya. You can get yer rest and sober up once yer inside the pubs.’


Very confused and Piss Drunk left the pub straightaway, their breath, heavy with the smell of alcohol. 


Piss Drunk advised Very Confused ‘The next pub is only half a mile away. We can’t race to it though, or we’ll look suspicious. They’re likely watchin’ the pubs, and if they see us lookin’ crafty, they’ll be after us.’
‘So if we swagger, all drunk and jolly, they’ll leave us alone?’ asked Very Confused.
‘Look at those poor unfortunate rummies, tsk, tsk’ parroted Pissed Drunk.


It was now nearly dusk as the two meandered their way along the narrow streets in lively spirits. Every now again, Very Confused would stop, cock his neck back, and with a scrunched face say,


‘Ay, where’ye think th’other pub is? I think the bartender at that last one was watterin’ down me drinks!’ 


Pissed Drunk had been on many drunken reconnoiters and new that a lively, nonthreatening, drunken swagger with no singing looked very suspicious. So, to not blow their cover, he belt out a rhyme or two.

Needless to say, the two put on a very convincing show, though there were few around to see. By this time, most people had gathered inside the homes they had drawn, some with companions and some without, but nearly all were reflecting upon a perfectly harmonious day. Some had spent their day at school, others had come from a days work in the field, still others returned from a tranquil day at the library. Very few however, spent their day seeking refuge in a pub. The two men arrived at their destination, Ye Olde Pub and Tavern #33, just after sunset.


‘We made it. wow, it’s getting’ chilly out there.’ Said Very Confused through chattering teeth. ‘You need to sing more. It’ll taker yer mind offa the cold.’ Responded Pissed Drunk.
‘Right, ‘ said Very Confused and he broke into song.


‘Well! I’m drunk and pissed
An’ I think we missed
A turn or two,
And gone ‘round the twist,
We’re lost, we’re lost, 
we’re…oops, no wait,
I merely forgot
To keeping walking straight.’


‘Ay, it’s not my fault you kept stoppin’ to ask where the pub was! Got me all confused. Yer rubbin’ off on me’ said Pissed Drunk.
‘No sir, I’m just usin’ ya fer balance!’ The two had tumbled into the pub, laughing and trying their best to keep each other propped up and on course.
‘So, you’ve arrived then’ said the bartender, ‘better start sobbering up. Here drink these’ and he handed them each a glass of water.
‘I got a message to expect two men travelling together, one with a black backpack. Message said yer barhoppin’ to the White House.’
‘Yes, that’s right, and we need to keep hydrated. How’s about two glasses of yer finest stout?’ asked a very inebriated Very Confused.
‘Comin’ right up,’ said the bartender.
‘Say, I like this pub!’ said Very Confused, ‘it’s warm, cozy, and smells like peanuts.’


(transition needed)


The bartender threw them both a grave look of apprehension. ‘Lads, if you spring them loons, we’ll have more drunks than we can handle. There’ll be pandamonium in the streets’ and putting both hands on the bar, leaned in and slowly poured out the words ‘Things will get messy.’
‘Them loons ain’t loons at all’ said Pissed Drunk as he lifted his glass and took a drink.
‘I was in there, I know. Almost everyone of’em is as sane as you or I might think we were…if we didn’t think drunks were loons. In fact, there’s plenty of’em like our Hungry in there. Snatched up and locked away for frightening the populace.’
‘Well,’ said the bartender ‘If those ain’t loons that are locked up, then here’s to the poor sober drunks locked up and dancin’ round in rainbow jumpers!’
He pointed to a sign hanging behind the taps which read ‘Keep it in The Bar, or They’ll Put You Behind Some.’
‘You prick! Don’t you know that this is their way of silencing the opposition?’ said Very Confused, now very irritated.
‘Don’t get me wrong son,’ said the bartender, now standing back up ‘I just think that one’s gotta be smarter than to go shootin’ their mouth off in this society. In fact, the only thing protectin’ them brainless rabble-rousers is the very thing they wanna get rid of…their anonymity,’ he continued, ‘ Society says, ‘Here ya go, do what you like today, you don’t have to do nothin’ fer yer food and shelter but draw some tickets, oh, and by da way, don’t worry ‘bout bein’ blamed fer nothin’ or singled-out ‘cause there’s  a million others that look just like ya’’ And these loud-mouthed nitwits, they say ‘No, thank you very much, I’d much rather be locked up in a rainbow jumper.’ The bartender said this as if he’d used it before, perhaps to silence other zealous patrons.

‘He’s got a point,’ said Pissed Drunk. ‘People here don’t have to do much to get by. In fact, as long as they don’t act at differently, they can do whatever they want.’
‘That’s right, ‘ said the bartender ‘On any day at any hour, you can do whatever you want, as long as ya do it just like everyone else.’
‘But,’ said Very Confused, ‘what if you see that the thing being done, could be done differently…could be done better?’
‘Well, ‘ said the bartender, ‘I would drop a note in the suggestion box, just like everyone else.’

There were suggestion boxes at each ticket station, and if one had an idea, opinion, or suggestion pertaining to the conditions at the scale to which the ticket station pertained—neighboorhood, apartment building—they would simply drop it in the box. Any citizen could open the box and look through the suggestions. This allowed each person to get an idea of how popular an idea was and whether it was worth submitting a similar suggestion. All changes were left to the general populace and the populace always preferred solidarity, uniformity, and anonymity. Otherwise, they would have to resort to employing a minority force to govern and police themselves; this was the most common opinion found in suggestion boxes.

‘So, if one is going to disagree with the majority, one had better do it under the influence’ replied Very Confused, ‘Very diplomatic.’
‘It’s about a half a mile to the next pub’ said Pissed Drunk, looking over his map.
‘There’ll be a lot of navigatin’ involved, and we can’t afford to get lost out there.’
‘Well, how do we make sure that doesn’t happen?’ asked Very Confused.
‘With these,’ replied Pissed Drunk as he grabbed the bowl of peanuts from the bar and poured them into one of his overcoat pockets.
‘Didn’t you ever wonder why bars have large bowls of peanuts?’ asked Pissed Drunk.
‘Well,’ said Very Confused, ‘I always presumed they were for eating.’

The bartender and Pissed Drunk looked at each other and burst into laughter.

‘What?’ asked Very Confused. ‘And pickled eggs, I suppose you presume those are for eating as well?’ ‘Well, yes,’ replied Very Confused.

The other two rolled with laughter.
‘I don’t understand,’ admitted Very Confused.
‘Bars, my confused friend, are at the forefront o’ this here war’ said the bartender.
‘When a patron leaves a bar, he needs to be prepared for whatever’s out there. So, he takes some peanuts to mark his path, a book o’ matches to make a fire if need be, and pickled eggs to drive back the masses.’ ‘And pickled pigs ears? What are those for?’ asked Very Confused. ‘Subsistance, of course!’ replied Pissed Drunk.
‘Seriously though boys,’ said the Bartender, ‘watch yerselves out there, and don’t go stirrin’ up any trouble.’
He leaned over and smelled the air around the two men.

‘I can hardly tell you’re drunk, you’d better have another before ye get on yer way.’

After having one last draught and stocking up on peanuts, pickled eggs and pigs ears, the two left the pub in search of their next destination, Cigar and Wine bar #4.
