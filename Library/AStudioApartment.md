#A Studio Apartment

‘The few bad poems which are occasionally created during abstinence are of no great interest.’—Wilhelm Reich

Wilhelm Reich, the sexually radical psychoanalyst of the early twentieth century was not a semelparous *Homo geneous*. Clearly, anyone willing to speak on the pitfalls of abstinence would have predicated their death long before writing The Mass Psychology of Facism or discovering orgastic potency. Reich's experimentation along side Dr. Sigmund Freud, would have been short-lived once he glimpsed his own "orgone".

Without looking the man made his way to the ticket station, selected his top three choices, pulled the knobbed level, and took the vended ticket from the mouth of the attendant. He then turned to look for the woman who had apparently been following him for the past two days. He nearly expected her to be standing across the street, looking at him the way a cat might eye a mouse. Seeing she was gone, he emptied his lungs and he leaned backwards onto the station. He felt the collapse of his chest and heard a metallic hammer-strike.

The bump against the machine rocked the jaw of the automotronic genie inside. The plastic eyes of the mechanical magician lit and the gears inside turned a claw that yanked at its intestinal roll of tickets. The claw plucked one and sent it up to the mouth. The man was struck dumb because he now had two tickets assigning two homes for the night. He hesitated to take the ticket from its mouth but had no choice. Leaving it there would only cause confusion for the next entrant. He decided to stick to his original ticket, but pocketed the other.

The ticket he drew at the corner of Congress and Clinton directed him to the stoop of an earthenware-colored Brownstone. He took another ticket from the box at the top of the stoop. It told him that tonight he was to reside in apartment 4. He entered through tall narrow doors, climbed a flight of varnished wooden stairs. At the top, he found a sign that directed him to apartment four. He had arrived just in-time for dinner.

‘Hi there!’ came a voice from the kitchen. ‘Hi back!’ came his response.

After hanging his scarf and jacket in the front closet and removing his shoes, crossed the warm hardwood floor of the living room, and planted himself on the sofa. His feet took flight, catapulted by the downward thrust of his body, and touched back down onto clean white carpet. The chestnut leather of the Manhattan welcomed his tired body. He felt safe at home.

‘How was your day?’ came the voice from the kitchen, becoming louder as it grew nearer. A woman entered the front room and crossed in front of him to turn on a lamp. 

‘That’s better. Wow, this is a nice apartment. Have you been here before?’ 

‘No, I haven’t.’ he replied. ‘Me neither,’ she said. ‘Wow, look at that couch! Do you mind if I try it?’ 

She settled onto the swanky sheepskin cushion next to him. This normally would not have bothered him, but his after earlier encounter with an all-to-eager female, one who had apparently been stalking him, the repitition was eerily reminiscent. ‘I'm going to get a glass. Want something?’ he asked.

"Red, please and thank you." Her head followed him over the half wall separating the living room from the studio apartment's small kitchen, "I tell you, after today, I could really use a drink."

Sitting back down on the sofa, he handed her glass. He seized the rare opportunity to avoid the discussion of his own odd day by entertaining that of someone else, without feigning interest. Indeed, he couldn't be more interested in forgetting his run-in with a Lunatic. "What happened?", he asked.

"What's the most number of days you've ever spent in a commune, consecutively?" came the echo inside her wine glass.

"Consecutively?" He asked, no entirely happy to have the conversation turned back on him so soon, "I don't know, maybe, four."

She laughed, "Oh wow, have you been lucky." She took another sip, as if pausing for effect, "I have been living in a commune for the last ten days! Can you imagine that? I mean, I've got nothing against staying with other people, but ten days in a squad bay on a bunk bed?"

"You're kidding me," he said. "That's incredible. I mean, it's horrible, but incredible, right? What are the odds of that happening?"

"Wow, that is something like...," She interrupted, "It's nearly five time ten to the eighth power! It might as well be practically impossible."

"Well, no," he said. "It might as well be practically impossible for it to happen again in your lifetime. I mean, you wouldn't expect that to happen again for another fifty four thousand seven hundred years or so." 

She stared at him, a bit blankly, "Right. You're not one of *those* guys are you? You know, one of those guys that never makes a decision without figuring out a probability."

"No, no, no," he hastily answered. "I only figure out the probability after I fail. The chance of success at most things is usually so low that most of the time, it'll be lower than what you think it is whenever you're wondering why you failed."

"So what you're saying is that you're the type of guy that uses probability as a soft shoulder to cry on." He stared at her, likewise, a bit blankly as she turned her head only slightly away to take another long graceful drink. This woman had a way of saying something slightly offensive right before putting the entire conversation on-hold with this small performance. 

"That's sort of depressing," she laughed. "but it's also sort of true. If I get what I expect or what I want, I usually don't look to probability for an explanation. I only go looking for the expectation of a failure after I've failed! Still, probability won't tell you why you failed. Probability will only give you the idea of whether you should have seen it coming."

"Now, you're being kind of depressing," he said. "Not all," she said. "I am pragmatic and I'm being strategic. I don't count on lotteries that I'm almost certain to fail in. But, I don't enter lotteries for things I don't really care for, even if there seems to be a great chance of winning."

"Then getting back to your week in a squad bay. I mean, the same squad bay. Wow," This time, it was he who took the long and exagerated sip. But, she replied immediately anyway, and left him with his nose buried in his glass. She said, "It was the appropriately rare occurrence of an exceedingly unlikely event. I'm just glad it's over."



 he replied. "But, you didn't go to the same machines did you? I mean, sometimes a gear in the damn geanie can get stuck."

"No, in fact, I barely repeated anything." She stared somewhat blankly at the carpet in front of him and continued, "Different jobs every day. Different cafes everyday. Different schools, different libraries, and definitely different machines. But everyday when it came time to draw that ticket, it was a squad bay. The same damn squad bay!"

He was practically stunned and they were both now staring at the carpet as if looking into the stitched and knotted threads of the very hairy universe. "That is...weird.", is all he could manage.





‘Right, one in six, cubed,’ she confirmed his answer.

Bath had six types of homes. There were 300 swanky couples apartments like that in the Brownstone they found themselves in, 600 artisan homes for singles where a solitary night would afford a person a good read or an uninterrupted excursion into the recesses of one’s mind, 100 Victorian-style family homes where a group of six could share a cozy night telling stories or playing board games, 60 monastery-style cloisters housing 10 each where a Spartan décor and peaceful surroundings fed one’s urges to contemplate the sublime, 600 single cozy loft apartments where one could drink his or her way to the sublime by the light of the Bath skyline, and 10 single sex squad bays housing 60 individuals each, where cooperation, physical exertion, self-discipline were the order of the day*. In total, there was room for three thousand six hundred people in the village of Bath. The population was closer to three thousand, so there were also unoccupied units on any night of the week. 

*Activities within the squad bays of Homo sapiens culture frequently involve nighttime excursions to the latrine, but for a semelparous species such as Homo geneous, such excursions would be suicide.

‘Wow, you look beat. Can I get you anything?’ Eyes that had earlier stared straight through him with convicting familiarity were now fixed on his furrowed brow. It was a bit creepy, being in the same house and being stared at by someone who did not know him, but that looked identical to someone who thought they did. He wanted a distraction from the strange woman whom he had left at the stone wall and this less strange but identical woman he now faced. He wanted the woman in front of him to speak to him without knowing him, without recognizing him, and see her eyes glance over his features without any indication of finding some novel distinguishing detail in them.
‘Tell me about your day,’ he asked.

‘Well,’ she said, ‘I teach a class called Foundations of Neutral Society. It is not an advanced class, but it is good to have the basics of equitable social structure in mind before tackling a class like The Rise of Lunacy*.’

Four bottles later, he had drowned the last concerns of his day away and found himself, as usual, enjoying the companionship of someone he took to be a perfect stranger. They talked about the early Spring weather, whether impressionism or photorealism was the more liberating art form, form and function of fractal branching tree branches, branches of primate evolution, evolution of social trends like hacking jackets and high-tops, high tops of the highest mountains and hidden meadows of the deepest hollow, how low the temperature might drop tonight and how romantic cobble park looked this time of year.

The next morning, the man stood in the bathroom and examined himself in the mirror above the sink. Obviously, they had not had sex the night before. Otherwise, our story would be short-lived; fatally anticlimatic in one sense but fatally climatic in another. Holding his hands in front of him with outstretched fingers, he inspected the front, back, digits, and nails of each. He could find no trace of a distinguishing scrape, cut, cuticle, pen-mark, callous, hang-nail, or mole. His hands were well taken care of. His fingernails were cut to length, he had no hang-nails, and his cuticles were clean. He inspected the back of his head with a hand-mirror. No cuts, scrapes, or scratches. No dirt or bald patches. No pimples, sores, or bruises. ‘Everything fits, everything matches.’ I don’t understand how she does it, whatever it is, that is what she catches.’  He thought to himself, ‘She could have only seen my hands, face, hair, neck, clothes, and my shoes. I had not worn the same clothes or shoes on both days, so there must be something wrong with my hair or skin.’

He called to the woman in the bedroom, ‘Can you come here?’
‘Sure’ came his companion’s voice.

She entered in a white silk bath robe. Imagine if you will, Benazir Bhutto in her late twenties, before her imprisonment in a desert cell in 1981. Imagine her standing in a white silk bath robe, clean and beautiful, not provocatively leaning or scantily dressed, but pure and elegant like a noble bird that gracefully moves about its wet hunting grounds, untouched by the muddy bottom. Her eyes, sultry and intelligent, capture your gaze and hold it at will. Her face beams with a happiness and wisdom that you will never know and of a sobriety that checks your confidence. Now, imagine about fifteen hundred more of these women and that one of them is stalking you. If you, the reader, are female, I would suggest reading this paragraph as if you were male. You can do this by re-reading the paragraph by paying special attention to the words ‘beautiful’, ‘sultry’, ‘women’, and ‘stalking you’.
‘I want you to look at me and tell me if there is anything different about me, if there is anything that might distinguish me.’ This kind of favor was commonplace before heading outside.
‘Let me see, no, no, turn around, no, no, oh wait.’
‘What is it?’ he asked.

‘Your collar is turned up in the back.’ She brought her hands close to his neck and turned down his collar. ‘Close call’ she said.
‘Is that it? Besides that, nothing is out of order?’ She gave him one last look ‘There, now you look completely indistinguishable. Where are you off to?’

Letting go of a stifled breath he replied ‘I am going back to school’.

His fingers grasped the brass door knob leading to outside freedom, and turned. The heavy door opened and sucked in the first notes of lilac. As the door opened to the outside world, the sun shoved its heavy foot inside and pushed against the door to reveal its withholdings and the dank guts of Brownstone’s insides. The man leaned forward, gathering the momentum to push off from one foot and onto the other, over-coming his inertia and engaging the cool sweetness of the illuminated outside. His eyes gathered the light in heaps and in their haste became dazzled and unable to hold it all. His pupils shrank to pin-points as the Spring air led him by his nose, flaring his nostrils and pulling him into the outside. ‘Ah, welcome and long-desired Spring!’*

*The first few lines of the fifth carmin of Carmina Burana, Ecce Gratum

It was a warm and sunny Spring day. ‘The first this year,’ he thought. Having spent the night in wonderful company and having encountered this beautiful day, he walked along with a spring in his step. He passed the corner of Steuben and Ganesvoort, crossed through the field and shook the oak’s hand, climbed the hill that bordered the causeway, made his way down Rumsey, past McMaster and Washington, and on having arrived back at the school, entered a lottery at the main doors. ‘I think I’ll choose Ethics of Identity, Pursuits of Individual Liberty, Intepretations of Personal Freedom, and Alternative Equittable Societies. Hopefully, I’ll get at least two of them,’ he said to himself. He entered his preferences and pushed Enter. The machine wizzed and whirled, the gears turns and engaged a claw, and the the claw drew his tickets. ‘Yes!’ he exclaimed. He got each of his first picks, and Ethics of Identity was the first.

As he entered the school building and made his way to his first class, thoughts of the strange woman creeped into his mind. ‘She could be watching right now, among the crowd of students,’ he thought. On the way to class, he tried to look as inconspicuous as possible; something most everybody did most every day. However, as he approached the classroom door, he felt as if he were being watched. This was a new and eery feeling; that someone might be watching him, following him. He felt exposed and began to wonder why he had even ventured out today. He refused to look up and search for the pair of eyes he felt were molesting him. His concern was, of course, largely unwarranted. Most people were not inclined to search for discrepancies, as it would make most anyone uncomfortable to find one.

He stood, momentarily outside the classroom. His first class of the day was Ethics of Identity. He looked around the hallway, hesitating to enter the classroom. The green ceramic tiles of the wall and their yellowed grout, the colored strata of the chipped paint covering the heavy metal frames and fixtures of the windows and stair railing revealed that they had been painted mainy times before. What small insects were caught in each freshly laid coat of paint? If we were to peel back each layer and reveal the corpses, would we accumulate all the insect species of Bath or just those prone to falling into fresh paint? If this school stood for a thousand years and our descendents were to peal back the layers of paint, would they uncover even more species of spider and fly and bee and bug? Perhaps, they would find species that had no business at this latitude or in this clime, but had lost a few of its kind to the traveling entomologist or had hitched rides on the backs of migrating geese or rogue winds. If this school stood for ten million years and our descendents, whether of our species or of some other, were to do the same, would they uncover species of spider and fly and bee and bug which had not existed ten million years prior, or would they find new forms altogether?

School hallways were buit to take a beating, to take the anxious stamping of feet up and down stairs, to weather the slams of lockers and classroom doors, to become littered and dirty during each day and thoroughly scrubbed and disinfected each night, to resist the pull of a hundred hands on railings, and a thousand feet carrying the swarm of more than one hundred thousand pounds every forty-five minutes. The window panes were large and thick. Some were transparent and allowed a limited view of the town and schoolyard and some were scalloped to diffuse and refract the light. The hallway had these scalloped windows at both ends and must have seemed to any passing giant that gazed inwards, to be a boring kind of kaleidoscope with its uniform and identical grey crystals moving about inside. He opened the door and stepped from the pale green acrylic tile over the threshold and into the classroom.
