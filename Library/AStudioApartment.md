#A Studio Apartment

‘The few bad poems which occasionally are created during abstinence are of no great interest.’—Wilhelm Reich

Clearly, Wilhelm Reich, the sexually inspired and radical psychoanalyst of the early twentieth century was not a semelparous Homo neutralis, for to have the authority to speak on the pitfalls of abstinence would have surely predicated his death before he could write The Mass Psychology of Facism or discover vegetotherapy and orgastic potency. His experimentations along side Dr. Sigmund Freud, would have been short-lived once he caught a glimpse of his own orgone.


Without looking back, he made his way to the ticket station, selected his top three choices, pressed ‘Enter’, took the ticket the machine vended, and turned. She was gone. He almost expected her to still be there. Now, he felt less rushed, as if he had been half pretending to be shocked and annoyed and now in his solitude, found it unnecessary to feign his panic. He emptied his lungs as he leaned backwards onto the station and felt the collapse of his chest. The jaw of the robotic genie inside the ticket station fell as if in shock of what it had witnessed. The plastic eyes of the mechanical magician lit-up, the gears inside turned a mechanical claw that yanked at some intestinal roll of tickets. The claw plucked one and sent it up to the mouth of the genie. Out came another ticket that assigned another home. The man was struck dumb by the genie’s gesture. He hesitatingly took the ticket from its mouth. ‘Two tickets telling me two go to two different houses. Great, just great. As if this day could not get any more confusing.’ He decided to stay with his original ticket, but pocketed the other, and resumed his journey home. 

The ticket he drew at the corner of Congress and Clinton directed him to the stoop of an earthenware-colored Brownstone. He took another ticket from the box at the top of the stoop. It instructed him that he was, for the night, to reside in Apt 4. He entered through tall narrow doors, climbed a flight of varnished wooden stairs. At the top, he found a sign that directed him to apartment four. He had arrived just in-time for dinner. 

‘Hi there!’ came a voice from the kitchen.
‘Hi back!’ came his response.

After hanging his scarf and jacket in the front closet and removing his shoes, he walked down the long hallway, past two bedrooms and a study, and crossed a dimly lit living room to plant himself onto the sofa. His feet took flight, catapulted by the downward thrust of his body, and touched solidly down onto clean white carpet. The chestnut leather of the Manhattan welcomed his tired body. He felt safe, immersed in the warm darkness of the living room.

‘How was your day?’ came the voice from the kitchen, becoming louder as it grew nearer. A woman entered the front room and crossed in front of him to turn on a lamp.

‘That’s better. Wow, this is a nice apartment. Have you been here before?’

‘No, I haven’t.’ he replied.

‘Me neither,’ she said. ‘Wow, look at that couch! Do you mind if I try it?’ 

She settled into a swanky sheepskin club chair that was directly across from him. This normally would not have bothered him but after what happened earlier, this immediate affront on his personal space bothered him.

‘I am going to get a beer. Want one?’ he asked.

‘Sure, I brought some home from work. Help yourself,’ she replied.
He had intended to go out for a beer, but given the eventfulness of his day, resided to see what the woman had brought. In the fridge, there were two ambers, two pale ales, and two stouts. ‘Well, at least she has good taste in beer,’ he said to himself. I will be going through a few of these tonight.’ And with that, he grabbed a pale ale and an amber.
‘I am cooking whole wheat pasta with lemon zest and basil’ she said.

‘Sounds great. I would have gotten to it, but I got held-up on the way here,’ he replied.

Sitting back down on the sofa, he handed her the pale ale. ‘I really needed this,’ she said. I have been living in a commune for the last three days. What are the odds of that?’

‘One in two hundred and sixteen,’ he replied.

‘Right, one in six, cubed,’ she confirmed his answer.

Bath had six types of homes. There were 300 swanky couples apartments like that in the Brownstone they found themselves in, 600 artisan homes for singles where a solitary night would afford a person a good read or an uninterrupted excursion into the recesses of one’s mind, 100 Victorian-style family homes where a group of six could share a cozy night telling stories or playing board games, 60 monastery-style cloisters housing 10 each where a Spartan décor and peaceful surroundings fed one’s urges to contemplate the sublime, 600 single cozy loft apartments where one could drink his or her way to the sublime by the light of the Bath skyline, and 10 single sex squad bays housing 60 individuals each, where cooperation, physical exertion, self-discipline were the order of the day*. In total, there was room for three thousand six hundred people in the village of Bath. The population was closer to three thousand, so there were also unoccupied units on any night of the week. 

*Activities within the squad bays of Homo sapiens culture frequently involve nighttime excursions to the latrine, but for a semelparous species such as Homo neutralis, such excursions would be suicide.

‘Wow, you look beat. Can I get you anything?’ Eyes that had earlier stared straight through him with convicting familiarity were now fixed on his furrowed brow. It was a bit creepy, being in the same house and being stared at by someone who did not know him, but that looked identical to someone who thought they did. He wanted a distraction from the strange woman whom he had left at the stone wall and this less strange but identical woman he now faced. He wanted the woman in front of him to speak to him without knowing him, without recognizing him, and see her eyes glance over his features without any indication of finding some novel distinguishing detail in them.
‘Tell me about your day,’ he asked.

‘Well,’ she said, ‘I teach a class called Foundations of Neutral Society. It is not an advanced class, but it is good to have the basics of equitable social structure in mind before tackling a class like The Rise of Lunacy*.’

Four bottles later, he had drowned the last concerns of his day away and found himself, as usual, enjoying the companionship of someone he took to be a perfect stranger. They talked about the early Spring weather, whether impressionism or photorealism was the more liberating art form, form and function of fractal branching tree branches, branches of primate evolution, evolution of social trends like hacking jackets and high-tops, high tops of the highest mountains and hidden meadows of the deepest hollow, how low the temperature might drop tonight and how romantic cobble park looked this time of year.

The next morning, the man stood in the bathroom and examined himself in the mirror above the sink. Obviously, they had not had sex the night before. Otherwise, our story would be short-lived; fatally anticlimatic in one sense but fatally climatic in another. Holding his hands in front of him with outstretched fingers, he inspected the front, back, digits, and nails of each. He could find no trace of a distinguishing scrape, cut, cuticle, pen-mark, callous, hang-nail, or mole. His hands were well taken care of. His fingernails were cut to length, he had no hang-nails, and his cuticles were clean. He inspected the back of his head with a hand-mirror. No cuts, scrapes, or scratches. No dirt or bald patches. No pimples, sores, or bruises. ‘Everything fits, everything matches.’ I don’t understand how she does it, whatever it is, that is what she catches.’  He thought to himself, ‘She could have only seen my hands, face, hair, neck, clothes, and my shoes. I had not worn the same clothes or shoes on both days, so there must be something wrong with my hair or skin.’

He called to the woman in the bedroom, ‘Can you come here?’
‘Sure’ came his companion’s voice.

She entered in a white silk bath robe. Imagine if you will, Benazir Bhutto in her late twenties, before her imprisonment in a desert cell in 1981. Imagine her standing in a white silk bath robe, clean and beautiful, not provocatively leaning or scantily dressed, but pure and elegant like a noble bird that gracefully moves about its wet hunting grounds, untouched by the muddy bottom. Her eyes, sultry and intelligent, capture your gaze and hold it at will. Her face beams with a happiness and wisdom that you will never know and of a sobriety that checks your confidence. Now, imagine about fifteen hundred more of these women and that one of them is stalking you. If you, the reader, are female, I would suggest reading this paragraph as if you were male. You can do this by re-reading the paragraph by paying special attention to the words ‘beautiful’, ‘sultry’, ‘women’, and ‘stalking you’.
‘I want you to look at me and tell me if there is anything different about me, if there is anything that might distinguish me.’ This kind of favor was commonplace before heading outside.
‘Let me see, no, no, turn around, no, no, oh wait.’
‘What is it?’ he asked.

‘Your collar is turned up in the back.’ She brought her hands close to his neck and turned down his collar. ‘Close call’ she said.
‘Is that it? Besides that, nothing is out of order?’ She gave him one last look ‘There, now you look completely indistinguishable. Where are you off to?’

Letting go of a stifled breath he replied ‘I am going back to school’.

His fingers grasped the brass door knob leading to outside freedom, and turned. The heavy door opened and sucked in the first notes of lilac. As the door opened to the outside world, the sun shoved its heavy foot inside and pushed against the door to reveal its withholdings and the dank guts of Brownstone’s insides. The man leaned forward, gathering the momentum to push off from one foot and onto the other, over-coming his inertia and engaging the cool sweetness of the illuminated outside. His eyes gathered the light in heaps and in their haste became dazzled and unable to hold it all. His pupils shrank to pin-points as the Spring air led him by his nose, flaring his nostrils and pulling him into the outside. ‘Ah, welcome and long-desired Spring!’*

It was a warm and sunny Spring day. ‘The first this year,’ he thought. Having spent the night in wonderful company and having encountered this beautiful day, he walked along with a spring in his step. He passed the corner of Steuben and Ganesvoort, crossed through the field and shook the oak’s hand, climbed the hill that bordered the causeway, made his way down Rumsey, past McMaster and Washington, and on having arrived back at the school, entered a lottery at the main doors. ‘I think I’ll choose Ethics of Identity, Pursuits of Individual Liberty, Intepretations of Personal Freedom, and Alternative Equittable Societies. Hopefully, I’ll get at least two of them,’ he said to himself. He entered his preferences and pushed Enter. The machine wizzed and whirled, the gears turns and engaged a claw, and the the claw drew his tickets. ‘Yes!’ he exclaimed. He got each of his first picks, and Ethics of Identity was the first.

As he entered the school building and made his way to his first class, thoughts of the strange woman creeped into his mind. ‘She could be watching right now, among the crowd of students,’ he thought. On the way to class, he tried to look as inconspicuous as possible; something most everybody did most every day. However, as he approached the classroom door, he felt as if he were being watched. This was a new and eery feeling; that someone might be watching him, following him. He felt exposed and began to wonder why he had even ventured out today. He refused to look up and search for the pair of eyes he felt were molesting him. His concern was, of course, largely unwarranted. Most people were not inclined to search for discrepancies, as it would make most anyone uncomfortable to find one.

He stood, momentarily outside the classroom. His first class of the day was Ethics of Identity. He looked around the hallway, hesitating to enter the classroom. The green ceramic tiles of the wall and their yellowed grout, the colored strata of the chipped paint covering the heavy metal frames and fixtures of the windows and stair railing revealed that they had been painted mainy times before. What small insects were caught in each freshly laid coat of paint? If we were to peel back each layer and reveal the corpses, would we accumulate all the insect species of Bath or just those prone to falling into fresh paint? If this school stood for a thousand years and our descendents were to peal back the layers of paint, would they uncover even more species of spider and fly and bee and bug? Perhaps, they would find species that had no business at this latitude or in this clime, but had lost a few of its kind to the traveling entomologist or had hitched rides on the backs of migrating geese or rogue winds. If this school stood for ten million years and our descendents, whether of our species or of some other, were to do the same, would they uncover species of spider and fly and bee and bug which had not existed ten million years prior, or would they find new forms altogether?

School hallways were buit to take a beating, to take the anxious stamping of feet up and down stairs, to weather the slams of lockers and classroom doors, to become littered and dirty during each day and thoroughly scrubbed and disinfected each night, to resist the pull of a hundred hands on railings, and a thousand feet carrying the swarm of more than one hundred thousand pounds every forty-five minutes. The window panes were large and thick. Some were transparent and allowed a limited view of the town and schoolyard and some were scalloped to diffuse and refract the light. The hallway had these scalloped windows at both ends and must have seemed to any passing giant that gazed inwards, to be a boring kind of kaleidoscope with its uniform and identical grey crystals moving about inside. He opened the door and stepped from the pale green acrylic tile over the threshold and into the classroom.
