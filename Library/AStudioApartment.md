#2. A Studio Apartment

‘The few bad poems which are occasionally created during abstinence are of no great interest.’—Wilhelm Reich

Wilhelm Reich, the sexually radical psychoanalyst of the early twentieth century was not a semelparous *Homo geneous*. Clearly, anyone willing to speak on the pitfalls of abstinence would have predicated their death long before writing The Mass Psychology of Facism or discovering orgastic potency. Reich's experimentation along side Dr. Sigmund Freud, would have been short-lived once he glimpsed his own "orgone".

Without looking the man made his way to the ticket station, selected his top three choices, pulled the knobbed level, and took the vended ticket from the mouth of the attendant. He then turned to look for the woman who had apparently been following him for the past two days. He nearly expected her to be standing across the street, looking at him the way a cat might eye a mouse. Seeing she was gone, he emptied his lungs and he leaned backwards onto the station. He felt the collapse of his chest and heard a metallic hammer-strike.

The bump against the machine rocked the jaw of the automotronic genie inside. The plastic eyes of the mechanical magician lit and the gears inside turned a claw that yanked at its intestinal roll of tickets. The claw plucked one and sent it up to the mouth. The man was struck dumb because he now had two tickets assigning two homes for the night. He hesitated to take the ticket from its mouth but had no choice. Leaving it there would only cause confusion for the next entrant. He decided to stick to his original ticket, but pocketed the other.

The ticket he drew at the corner of Congress and Clinton directed him to the stoop of an earthenware-colored Brownstone. He took another ticket from the box at the top of the stoop. It told him that tonight he was to reside in apartment 4. He entered through tall narrow doors, climbed a flight of varnished wooden stairs. At the top, he found a sign that directed him to apartment four. He had arrived just in-time for dinner.

‘Hi there!’ came a voice from the kitchen. ‘Hi back!’ came his response.

After hanging his scarf and jacket in the front closet and removing his shoes, crossed the warm hardwood floor of the living room, and planted himself on the sofa. His feet took flight, catapulted by the downward thrust of his body, and touched back down onto clean white carpet. The chestnut leather of the Manhattan welcomed his tired body. He felt safe at home.

‘How was your day?’ came the voice from the kitchen, becoming louder as it grew nearer. A woman entered the front room and crossed in front of him to turn on a lamp. 

‘That’s better. Wow, this is a nice apartment. Have you been here before?’ 

‘No, I haven’t.’ he replied. ‘Me neither,’ she said. ‘Wow, look at that couch! Do you mind if I try it?’ 

She settled onto the swanky sheepskin cushion next to him. This normally would not have bothered him, but his after earlier encounter with an all-to-eager female, one who had apparently been stalking him, the repitition was eerily reminiscent. ‘I'm going to get a glass. Want something?’ he asked.

"Red, please and thank you." Her head followed him over the half wall separating the living room from the studio apartment's small kitchen, "I tell you, after today, I could really use a drink."

Sitting back down on the sofa, he handed her glass. He seized the rare opportunity to avoid the discussion of his own odd day by entertaining that of someone else, without feigning interest. Indeed, he couldn't be more interested in forgetting his run-in with a Lunatic. "What happened?", he asked.

"What's the most number of days you've ever spent in a commune, consecutively?" came the echo inside her wine glass.

"Consecutively?" He asked, no entirely happy to have the conversation turned back on him so soon, "I don't know, maybe, four."

She laughed, "Oh wow, have you been lucky." She took another sip, as if pausing for effect, "I have been living in a commune for the last ten days! Can you imagine that? I mean, I've got nothing against staying with other people, but ten days in a squad bay on a bunk bed?"

"You're kidding me," he said. "That's incredible. I mean, it's horrible, but incredible, right? What are the odds of that happening?"

"Wow, that is something like...," She interrupted, "It's nearly five time ten to the eighth power! It might as well be practically impossible."

"Well, no," he said. "It might as well be practically impossible for it to happen again in your lifetime. I mean, you wouldn't expect that to happen again for another fifty four thousand seven hundred years or so." 

She stared at him, a bit blankly, "Right. You're not one of *those* guys are you? You know, one of those guys that never makes a decision without figuring out a probability."

"No, no, no," he hastily answered. "I only figure out the probability after I fail. The chance of success at most things is usually so low that most of the time, it'll be lower than what you think it is whenever you're wondering why you failed."

"So what you're saying is that you're the type of guy that uses probability as a soft shoulder to cry on." He stared at her, likewise, a bit blankly as she turned her head only slightly away to take another long graceful drink. This woman had a way of saying something slightly offensive right before putting the entire conversation on-hold with this small performance. 

"That's sort of depressing," she laughed. "but it's also sort of true. If I get what I expect or what I want, I usually don't look to probability for an explanation. I only go looking for the expectation of a failure after I've failed! Still, probability won't tell you why you failed. Probability will only give you the idea of whether you should have seen it coming."

"Now, you're being kind of depressing," he said. "Not all," she said. "I am pragmatic and I'm being strategic. I don't count on lotteries that I'm almost certain to fail in. But, I don't enter lotteries for things I don't really care for, even if there seems to be a great chance of winning."

"Then getting back to your week in a squad bay. I mean, the same squad bay. Wow," This time, it was he who took the long and exagerated sip. But, she replied immediately anyway, and left him with his nose buried in his glass. She said, "It was the appropriately rare occurrence of an exceedingly unlikely event. I'm just glad it's over."

"So, you didn't go to the same machines did you?" he asked, and in a way that he meant to signal empathy, continued on, "I mean, sometimes a gear in the bottom of the geanie can get stuck."

"Why is it that, whenever men think that something is awry with a lottery, they think they can just open up the damn thing and fix it? As if any of you really know what all those gears and springs and hammers do. I laugh everytime I walk past a ticket machine and one guy has his hand up a geanie's ass while three other men are standing around watching and talking about what the fourth should be doing. Any day now, we'll all have to revert back to drawing paper stubs from clay pots because you all can't admit your bad luck and can't keep from blaming the damn machines." Once again, she turned her slender neck and took her long sip.

"Wow, a week in the female squad bay really did things to you, didn't it?", He took the upper-hand with less than half the words.

"You've no idea," she replied. "I barely repeated anything. Different jobs every day. Different cafes everyday. Different schools, different libraries, and definitely different machines. But everyday when it came time to draw that ticket for a home, it was a squad bay. The same damn squad bay."

"That is...weird.", is all he could manage. "Yup." She took her sip and stared at him, like a cat to a mouse. Eyes that were identical to those of the stalker were now fixed on his own. 

"Tell me about your day," she asked.
