#In Taberna


‘People go to church for the same reasons they go to a tavern: to stupefy themselves, to forget their misery, to imagine themselves, for a few minutes anyway, free and happy.’—Mikhail Bakunin 




A war torn bar stood in the middle of a one-room pub. The bar was framed-out in heavy oak slabs and varnished in coats of turpentine, linseed oil, and the spilt remnants of single malt scotch and bottom shelf whiskey. The salty wooden veteran had held the heads of a hundred wounded soldiers and dropped twice as many bold and brazen braggarts onto the gritty floor below. It offered rations for the weary rifleman; a bowl of peanuts, a pickled egg. It protected the man that served up the libations and protracted the man who had had one two many. You told your stories to it, whether you thought some person was listening or whether you thought you were merely speaking to reaffirm your own existence. It told a thousand stories, taught a thousand lessons, and kept a close company of soldiers, minute-men, and men-at-arms. Now, it watched as a precarious man and frazzled woman entered the tavern and crossed the room.
A cracked and drunken eye floats in an amber haze and spies two bobbing blurs become larger, getting nearer. One blur mumbles something to the other and they both shoot towards the ceiling while the rummy’s head flops onto his chest. His neck is now a useless string that attaches a drowned orb to a battered wastebasket of a body. If it were not for his limp posture, some passing ogre could have plucked him from his bar stool and used him to play boliche. You can imagine how hard it would be to land a man’s head squarely in his rib-cage with a flacid boliche handle. The drunk speaks a sentence or two of fluent mumble, but the blurs do not respond to his greeting. His eyes tighten as he draws a deep and hollow breath. He releases it through nearly collapsed nostrils and is no more energized for having taken it. He opens two yellowed and bloodshot eyes and realizes that there are four, not two blurs. There are also twice as many of everything as he had originally surmised. No wonder he was so drunk, he had drank twice as much as what he thought was in front of him.  
The tavern, a weather-beaten fort of a bygone revolution, no longer held an army of battle-ready men. The companies of rough and rugged soldiers had long since evacuated into the shops and hid, all of them, beneath tweedy charcoal carapaces and fancy flannel scarves. No longer did roudy men arm-wrestle on her heavy tables, and no longer did ruddy women dance over them. No longer did the poet and the philosopher and the inventor raise pints of hearty black lager over their table and set to arguing about their factory wages and the delapedated state of their break room. The dart board stood in some far back forgotten corner, once a practice range for archers, now a bulls-eye to aim one’s head toward when seeking a place to piss. The pool table that had once served as a canvas for plans of attack, now  stood as a memorial to those killed-in-action. No graves sites, no tombstones, only an empty field of green to remember those fallen anonymous. These days, the old fort merely provided a last bastion of protection for those few individuals that were either incapable of conforming to what the rest of society agreed on, or were allergic to tweed. It welcomed them crackling fires, amber hues, and warm wood. Of course, some patrons just came to have a drink.
‘What can I get ya?’ asked the bartender.
‘Black lager, thank you’ ‘and I’ll have a coffee with two shots of amarretto’ said he and she in that order.
The bartender turned to his task.
‘Say, did you two hear about what happened at the University?’ the patron leaned over and peered at them with drunken eyes.
They shook their heads no.
‘Some Lunatic went stark ravin’ made outside a school buildin’, started rantin’ and ravin’ about social upheaval…Damn the consequences!’
The patron gave the bar a heavy slap and with that, took a long pull from his bottle of licorice stout. He sat grinning at them and chuckling to himself. The inebriate was supported on nearly all sides by the bar or bar furniture and, if anyone of these were to give, he would have collapsed onto the floor like a marionette, cut from its strings. But as it were, this sot merely sat in sprawling recline and looked at them. They waited for the next tug of the puppeteer that would make this limp tosspot spring to life like a spritely drunken monkey. Instead, the drunken patron lifted his liter of licorice stout, took another pull, and let his arm with bottle in-hand, fall to his side. Some of the black brew spilled onto his trousers, and at seeing this and at seeing them seeing this, he mumbled in fluent bacchanal, ‘Oh fawke it. Fawke me w’thit. Maybe then I kin die an’ leave this foresaken worlde.’ The difference in perceived time between Houseflies and Barflies is enormous. A day in the life a Housefly passes during the time it takes for the head of a Barfly to time-travel from three feet above his barstool to floor of the tavern.
Barflies, contrary to popular belief and all of evolutionary biology, are not related to House flies, Deer flies, Bee flies, Robber flies, or Horse flies. Unlike Farfalle and the other true flies, Barflies are not dipterans at all. Furthermore, Barflies are not closely related to Dragonflies, Mayflies, Butterflies, or Scorpionflies. Indeed, Barflies are neither true flies nor flies of another nature. Barflies are, in fact, members of the genus  Phyllophaga of the sub-family Melolonthinae which belong to the order Coleoptera, the beetles. Phyllophaga includes those small heavy-bodied and aimless animals which we commonly call June bugs, June beetles, and May beetles. That barflies are actually beetles is evidenced by the presence of a pair of wings that have been modified as wing coverings, called elytra. In barflies, the elytra have been modified to provide warmth and are often textured like tweed or wool, and so can be easily confused with a person’s coat.
A close observation of the Barfly’s behavior is sufficient to tell a Barfly from an intoxicated Homo sapiens or Homo neutralis that is attempting one or more forms of mimicry. Though June bugs can be awfully hard to follow, they provide a ready supply of food for the predator that catches them on their back. Why anyone would want to mimic a June bug is beyond me, but remember, we are talking about the attempts of intoxicated apes to blend in to a bar scene dominated by incredibly large and powerful armored insects. I can just imagine being called out by Barfly…”Ey you, yes you. The one sittin’ o’er there gaspin’ fer air. How’s a come you ain’t got not spiracles, not to mention ain’t got but four legs?”
The Barfly in the corner of this tavern was nearing the end of his rope and would probably be spinning on his back by the time last call was announced. At the moment he sat, and with one squinted eye, threw sideways glances at Hungry and her companion. This all looked a bit odd because the crazy drunken thing was facing them from no less than eight feet away while it did this. 
        The Barfly’s odd behavior put the two on-edge. One never knows when a Barfly could lash out. In fact, it has been told to me that the haphazard flight of a Barfly can be influenced by staring at it, and that the more one stares at a meandering buzzing Barfly the more likely the Barfly is to come straight for the on-looker. Having this in-mind, Hungry and her companion moved to a booth farthest from the patron Barfly and close to the front door. The bartender turned to the Barfly ‘I wonder who’s relieving me? I have to skim the plum wine in a few hours.’
‘I’ll do it!’ hailed the bacchanal beetles, as he lifted his bottle to the sky.
‘Well, you will have to start sobering up then. I Cannot have you being your own best customer, now can I?’
The patron Barfly retreated, ‘Well, since you put’er that way, I am feelin’ a bit under the weather. Me throat’s just killing me. Better hand me a scotch, so’s I can rub it down with alcohol.’


‘Ay, you two like a bit o’ company?’ The patron had found them through what must have been a hazy cloud of amber fog, distorted and bent through an alcoholic vitreus. He made his way over to them, lumbering through invisible knee-high syrup.
‘We’re good over here, thanks’ replied the man.
‘Ah rubbish! What er ye drinkin’?’ said the patron.
The patron, a foot from their booth, bent half over, though a bit too much and had to take a step forward to catch himself on their table. The puppeteer was having fun with them and, like any annoying puppeteer might, was accosting them with the creepy slave through which he worked his mischevious subconscious.
‘Whoa, all hands on deck!’ said the drunk patron as he swirled around.
‘Barkeep! Me good man, three draughts o’er here if ee’will be so kinde.’ He said all this as he made his pirouette, and finished his order just he landed in front of them.
‘Whoo, am I pissed!’
Hungry’s eyes lit up.
The man sat stunned, the mug of lager hanging in his mouth and his most recent sip trailing back into it.
‘Are you?’ said Hungry.
‘Am I what?’ said the patron.
‘Are you pissed?’ said Hungry.
‘Oh, piss drunk, indeed!’ said the patron.
‘Wow,’ exclamined Hungry, ‘You have two names!’
‘Beg yer pardon ma’am? I didn’t catch yer last.’
‘It’s nice to meet you Piss Drunk.’
‘Uh well, it’s uh, a pleasure to meet you miss.’ 
The curious man sat horrified.
‘I am hungry’ said Hungry.
‘Well, if I’m Piss Drunk and yer Hungry…this poor chap must be Very Confused!’
The man spoke up ‘No, please, don’t give her any ideas.’
‘That is perfect!’ said Hungry ‘Very Confused, it really fits you. We are Piss Drunk, Hungry, and Very Confused!’
Hungry and Piss Drunk rolled and slapped the table as they laughed uncontrollably.
‘Three draughts’ said the bartender, as he turned and walked off.
‘Ay, barkeep, yer one uh the good ones.’
Piss Drunk took his mug in-hand, a full and heavy pewter weapon, and lowering his head to meet it halfway to his nose, inhaled the chocolate malts through the thick foam head. A wide smile stretched across his face and he poured the black liquid into it. He pulled the mug from his mouth and was left with a mustache of alcoholic foam. He then swallowed and said,
‘Damn this head is nearly as thicke as mine!’ he said.
‘Hungry, we should go’ said Very Confused.
‘I’ll not hear of it!’ said Piss Drunk.
‘We just got our drinks.’ 
‘No sir, we did not order those drinks, you are obviously mistaken.’
The patron replied, ‘She’s right, ya know, you are very confused. Only a man who is very confused, such as yerself, could mistake a man who is piss drunk for being obviously mistaken. Perhaps, sir, you are obviously mistaken and very confused, and by extension suffering from an identity crisis!’
Hungry and Pissed Drunk rolled and laughed and slapped the table until they cried. Very Confused sat staring at Hungry.
‘Aw come now, drink up’ Piss Drunk pushed their drinks in front of them. ‘Let’s have a toast!’ he said.
‘A toast to what?’ asked Very Confused.
‘A toast to being hungry, piss drunk, and very confused in these dark, dark times!’
And with that, he raised his glass far overhead, so far in fact that his momentum overtook him and he fell backwards onto the thick wooden slats of the bar floor. 


‘Don’t mind him. He does this every night’ echoed the bartender across the room.
‘Every night? For what?’ asked Hungry.
‘It’s the only place he can get away with it.’ Replied the bartender.
‘Get away with what?’ asked Hungry.
‘Acting out. Out there it’ll get you locked away. In here, it’ll just get your ticket and keys taken from you. The public doesn’t mind people acting out, as long as they’re drunk and glued to the bar floor when they’re doing it.’
‘That poor man’ said Hungry, looking at Pissed Drunk as he peeled himself from the floor.
‘Ah look, I still got it!’ 


Amazingly, Pissed Drunk had kept his mug upright for the entire fall and was now seating himself back at the table of the booth where the other two sat staring at him.


‘Hey, hey, you two wanna hear a poem?’ he asked.
‘Why not’ replied Very Confused as he took a swig of his lager.
‘This one is adapted from very old poem conceived in a land very far away. It’s called Consumed with Rage*.’ …


Consumed with rage, just look at them,
of doubt, they have o’plenty,
in their sorrow, two denay      
liquor has ‘em benty.
fact is, their hysteria,
hot like caliente,
is vegetative siloloquy,
day will show it’s empty.


Come, sit, hear a proprium,
of heroin and sentry,
who shook a stable cobble house
built by whips of gentry.
Stunted egos in uproar,
for lack of outside entry,
some were crushed and done away,
none not permanently.


*The translated title of the 11th carmen, Estuans Interius, of Carmina Burana. The author advises the reader to review this work, of which, Pissed Drunk has made a colorful adaptation of meaning and meter.


‘That’s terrible!’ yelled the Bartender.
‘Aye piss off, you!’ retorted Piss Drunk. 




With Pissed Drunk laid out in a booth, the two companions were left to themselves.


‘In case you’re wondering, Hungry, we can’t take him along with us. We have no way of recognizing him, and besides, he might be a different person once he sobers up. He might turn you in himself.’
Hungry, had to agree. They didn’t know the man in the next room, and neither of them would be able to recognize him if he were sober.


‘Hey what’s that?’ Hungry was pointing to a backpack on the floor.
‘It must belong to him. Do you want to take a look inside?’
‘I don’t know, what if…’ but it was too late, she was already unzipping it to look inside.
‘Oh wow, look at this!’ She pulled out a thick leather-bound notebook along with several travel bottles of liquor, a multi-utility tool, a first-aid kit, a flashlight, and a road atlas.
‘Who is this guy?’ asked Very Confused to nobody in particular.
‘Hungry, I don’t know about this guy. He seems…unstable.’
‘Unstable? And what are we Very Confused?’


They talked at length about their new companion, his drinking, his poem, and the contents of his survival kit-like backpack. Pissed Drunk did not seem like the kind of guy that seeks to fall in-line with the masses, he certainly seemed to be jovial man, and he seemed to catch onto names for people pretty well. They decided they would invite him along to join them. The next day, Hungry woke to find the two men talking over coffee and danishes.


‘What a night! I hadn’t been that pissed since earlier that morning.’
‘And you do this every day?’
‘Creature of habit, I suppose. I prefer the reliability of a regimented life.’
‘Right, well I can’t knock you for not being committed.’
‘Indeed my confused companion, I very well should be.’
‘What? Committed?’
Hungry greeted them ‘Good morning Very Confused. Good morning Pissed Drunk.’
Piss Drunk raised his cup of coffee to her ‘Good morning, my strange bird’ he said.
‘You’re right, she takes these names quite seriously.’
‘I told you, and there is no use in getting her to change them. She has been calling herself Hungry for days now.’
‘Well, my poor thing, sit and have a danish, have two!’ Hungry sat down with her coffee and reached for a blueberry danish.
‘So what are our plans?’ asked Hungry.
The three settled their tab and left the bar. Hungry was excited to continue their journey and to leave this oppressive place, as she referred to it.  


The Bartender yelled after them ‘Hey now, you don’t wanna be wanderin’ outta no bar in broad daylight. There’s bound to be lunatics out there!’


They heard her yell almost immediately after leaving the bar. Very Confused and Pissed Drunk ran out of the bar and immediately found their way blocked by a readied mob of snatchers. Hungry had been captured, but was beating several snatchers off of her. ‘Stop!’ cried Very Confused. Hungry was being drug off by four men…she was dragging two more with her. She screamed to her companions ‘Go!’, to her captives and captors,


‘You bastards! I will rip you apart! Is that all you got! Hahahaha!’. Between her and her companions lay a small heap of unconscious men and women and a pursuant mob ready to snatch Hungry’s companions.

‘So, are they going to be waiting until we go outside? Are they going to force us back inside?’ asked Very Confused.
‘Oh no, most patrons aren’t real threats. Most just drink their fill and stagger home.’
‘So then, what are we going to do about Hungry?’ continued Very Confused with several more questions waiting in the wings.
‘I think it’s safe to say they’ve locked her up. Barkeep! Two draughts if you will.’
‘We have to get her out, Pissed Drunk. We can’t let her stay there.’
        The bartender brought their drinks ‘Here you go lads,’
He didn’t walk off but, hesistated, and then spoke ‘You two look as if yer runnin’ from somethin’.’
‘A mob, my good barkeep. Lunatics nabbed our companion, Hungry.’
‘The bastards!’ responded the Bartender.
‘You know where they took her?’ he asked.
‘We’ve got a pretty good idea’ responded Piss Drunk.
‘I don’t’ added Very Confused. ‘How about filling me in?’
Piss Drunk replied to them both, ‘More’n likely, they took her to The White House.’
‘The White House!’ exclaimed the bartender.
‘The White House?’ asked Very Confused.
‘It’s where they take the hostile ones, the dangerous rabble rousers. Hungry must’ve laid six of ‘em out before they nabbed her. She probably pummelled’em the entire way there, the White House, that is.’
‘And where is this White House?’ asked Very Confused.
‘Pretty far from here,’ replied the bartender.
‘Let’s have a look,’ said Piss Drunk as he opened his map of Bath.


He turned to the page containing the sections of the city (see map).


‘We’re here, in section G1. The White House is over here, in section A10. We’ve got a ways to go, and a lot of lunatics to avoid in doin’ it.’
‘Lunatics,’ sighed Very Confused, ‘I have heard they believe some strange things, like the idea that unpredictable events can be determined by passing stars or by wishing out loud or even by doing what someone else says.’


‘Well, there’s more to it than that, me olde son,’ said Piss Drunk, and he explained what a lunatic was,


‘A Lunatic is a person that talks twice as long to give you half a useless explanation, and would talk half as long to give you twice the useless explanation, if you let them do it. Indeed, if a Lunatic were to increasingly increase the uselessness of his explanation, he would not need to say a word. Unfortunately, most Lunatics do give the most useless explanations possible, but only use the time they save to further explain themselves.’  


‘Wow!’ said Very Confused, are there a lot of them?.
‘Well, they are growing in numbers for sure. Now, what you need to understand about Lunacy is that Lunacy is a working body of superfluous explanation for things that exist and the only working body of knowledge for things that do not. These two qualities of Lunacy allow Lunatics to explain everything in the most useless way possible, making it very effective to their cause. However, Lunatics can’t predict much into the future and have had an equally hard time predicting things in the past, so they’re nearly always left with trying to explain things away as the facts pop-up.’   


‘That is totally mental! I cannot believe I have never heard of Lunacy before!’ said Very Confused.
‘Well,’ said Piss Drunk, ‘The room for Lunacy has always existed in Bath, bein’ so open and free thinkin’ as it is. Perhaps, you should know how it all got started.’
