#Ethics of Identity
‘The names of men are, of course, as cheap and meaningless as Bose and Tray, the names of dogs’—Henry David Thoreau

He entered his top three choices for seating, pressed Enter, and took his ticket from the lottery machine. Having drawn his seat, A-7, he withdrew a textbook from the red painted cubby near the door, hung his jacket on the hook that read A-7, and took his seat. From the teacher’s perspective, he was in the last row of the left-most column, that is, the rear left corner. He had entered when the class was nearly half full. If he was to evade detection, there was no sense in either arriving too early or too late. 
Like hallways, classrooms were built to take beatings, though less severe ones. Each hinge on each desktop performed thousands mechanical butterfly flaps each year. Each desktop had held the hands, arms, and elbows of a thousand eager minds, and the heads of a hundred less eager ones. Maps and projector screens furled and unfurled without complaint, blackboards and whiteboards weathered the exposition of Markov chains, linear algebra, and paleobiological pedagogory of impromptu instructors and took the punishing scribblings of their students. Only the chalk and dry erase markers complained.
The class had filled by the time he returned from his imagination. Now, he was bordered by three women, and once again, felt completely exposed. He thought, just for a moment, that the one to his left seemed a bit out-of-place. He normally tried to mind his manners and ignore these kinds of discrepancies, but her eyes seemed different than those of the woman ahead of her. Indeed, her eyes were ever so slightly accentuated by an amount of eyeliner that was clearly out of standard among women. 
‘I hope no one stares at her. I hope she discovers it before next period. Perhaps, I should slip her a note and leave class,’ he thought, and then corrected himself, ‘No, no, I must act natural. That crazy woman could be in here and she is probably looking for a man acting a bit strange.’ It was still three minutes until class formally began and he would have to find something to do to not draw attention to himself. He opened his book to no particular page: Chapter 7, section 3, Identity Crisis and other Dementias. ‘That’s fitting’ he said to himself as read on. 
From the book:
‘An identity crisis is a failure during adolescent development to emerge into adulthood with a fully formed and coherent sense of self-image. Those that enter in adulthood without positive self-images, or highly inaccurate ones, are prone to the outward expression of the crisis. This is most often characterized by the following symptoms:
1. Anxiety associated with feeling different from people of the same gender. 
2. Paranoia of being followed or identified.
3. Excessive attempts to assimilate, such as mimicking others.
4. Refusal to speak out of suspicion that one sounds differently than others.
5. Refulsal to leave a domicile by the sixth day of development. After eating its parents, the newly matured adult will sometimes build a tent out of sheets on their bed and laze about reading fantasy novels.


Acute Adult Latent Onset Identity Crises can be formed when a discrepancy with one’s self is found or imagined (e.g. a mark on one’s cheek from a permanent marker) but most commonly occur when a person suffers a temporary or permanently distinguishing disfigurement (e.g. loss of a digit, inability to maintain the currently trending skin-tone, laryngitis). Those with identity crisis deserve our utmost care and sympathy, and are often provided with the necessary rehabilitation and treatment.’


‘Hi there,’ came the voice of a woman in from of him. ‘Getting a bit ahead aren’t you? We are only covering chapter 5 today, Dishonesty: outright lying by social outliers.’ She smiled at him with no sign of particular familiarity.
‘Uh right, I am just flipping through pages.’ He replied. 
The woman to his left leaned toward him, ‘Are you sure you are not engaging in a bit of self-diagnosis?’
His world went silent, drowned-out by the deafening ring of his shock. She, the stalker, was seated next to him. He was absolutely frozen. Unable to engage his body to flee, he sat and stared at the page in front of him. The words blurred together and raced by without being read. The woman was still leaning over and staring at him. His hands were wrenched onto the front of his desk and a moist cave was growing beneath them. ‘What do I do?’ he thought. He freed his grip on the desk and noticed the patches of condensed perspiration that had grown underneath them. He jerked his head sharply to face her, but before he could do so, 
‘It’s time to begin,’ announced the teacher.
His acidic greeting to the woman, which would have been delivered through clenched and straining teeth, ‘What is wrong with you!’ was cut short at the enunciation of the first ‘W’, leaving his mouth distorted and his lips pursed and causing the strange stalking woman to giggle. Instead, the acid sat in his mouth and ate away his enamel. His swallowed his words but stared into the eyes of the lunatic next to him, as if trying to burn out her eyes. She deflected his beams with a shield that was tempered with the sheer delight of seeing him again. She leaned in but four inches from his nose and mouthed the words ‘Hi there’ through a smile that was almost to wide and too tight to manage the expression.
The teacher began, ‘Today, we will be discussing forms of dishonesty, their motivators, initiators, and their consequences. Now, I am sure that we are all familiar with some of the motivators for dishonesty. The motivation to be passively dishonest or to outright lie is often the potential to assimilate into a crowd or, more importantly, to maintain one’s anonymity after some traumatic or distressing event*. For example, while practicing for the 1994 Bath Olympics, an anonymous female ice skater fell on the collapsible tire checker of a man apparently looking for tires on the Bath ice rink. The incident resulted in a distinguishing bruise on the leg of the woman and undo attention to the confused man looking for tires on an ice rink. The mortified woman tried her best to conceal the bruise and did not seek immediate medical attention. As a result, a blood clot formed in her leg, became lodged in her femoral artery, and caused a great deal of tissue damage leading to amputation. Had the woman accepted her temporary disfigurement and sought medical treatment, she would avoided a much graver permanent disfigurement. A year later the woman mated, and having not the resources to supply adequate nutrition to her offspring, produced a smaller than average daughter who later suffered for her mother’s distress.’   
He could not concentrate, not with that woman sitting next to him. In a desperate act to free himself he stood up, walked to the front of the class, and left. No one quite knew what to make of it.
He gasped for breath as soon as he pushed through the main doors of the school, as if the air inside was too thick to breathe. He leaned against the brick exterior, chest heaving and mind racing,


‘I should have never come back. I should have never come back. Stupid.’ His eyes darted back to the main doors. ‘She’ll be coming through any moment. She’ll be looking for me.’ He bolted behind a corner of the school building. He figured that she would be at school, but he didn’t plan on even seeing her—or her seeing him—until after the second class. Not only was she in the class, she was seated right next to him. What were the odds? ‘No way, astronomically small, I’m losing it.’ He should have run further.


‘Are you okay?’ came her voice. She was peering at him from around the corner.
‘What is wrong with you!’ he shouted. ‘How could you have just wound up sitting next to me? The chances are…’
‘Really small, I know,’ she replied, ‘Actually, I chose a ticket that had me seated on the other side of the room. Since the room was half empty anyway, I just sat next to you.’ 


The possibility never entered his mind. Sure someone might want to sit next to the windows or near the door, but choosing to sit next to someone, a specific someone. She was radical, destructive, did as she wished and damned the consequences. ‘Oh my!’ he gasped, ‘You’re a Lunatic!’.
‘I most certainly am not!’ she shouted.
‘Then why would you do that? You know what, nevermind,’ he said.
‘I did that because a person cannot just ignore someone they recognize, especially if that person is the only person they recognize, and especially if that person is the only person that can be recognized, and most especially if I am the only person that recognize a person.’
 She seemed impressed with her reply.
 ‘I’ve never done that before, it was so…neat. I was really hoping that you would be at school and in that class. It seemed to be a class you might take interest in.’ 
At this, he hunched over, clutched his knees, and threw up.
‘Oh my! You’re sick. We should get you home.’ She put a gentle hand on his shoulder.
‘Get away from me, you freak!’ He stood up and kicked some fallen leaves over his breakfast. ‘Do you realize what you said? It seemed like a class I might take? You don’t know me. Nobody knows me!’
She took a step toward him. ‘I know you more than anyone has ever known anyone.’
‘This is too much, just too much. I can’t breathe, I can’t brea.... You’re insane, I gotta get help,’ he said through hyperventilated gasps. His entire world had been violated. He had to run.


‘Hey, what’s going on over there?’ A man heard the two arguing and had come from around the corner. He was now standing in front of them, waiting for an explanation.
‘She knows. She knows who I am!’
The newcomer was startled. ‘She what!?’ he said. 
The women calmly turned to the newcomer and said ‘This man suffers from an identity crisis, he is very confused.’
‘Very confused, indeed!’ said the newcomer.
‘What? You liar! You’re a terrible person!’ the poor very confused man cried.

The newcomer nodded, ‘Too bad, I’m sorry to hear it, but shouldn’t he be somewhere safe?’ The man, the very confused one, was stupefied. 
The woman replied ‘Yes, he should, but unfortunately he’s under the impression that although he’s different from everyone else, he’s not so different as to pretend to be like everyone else. It can be hard to hang on to someone who’s resorted to dishonesty, especially self-dishonesty.’ He was infuriated. ‘Why you!’ He stepped toward her with hostile intentions but stopped, catching himself before appearing to the whole outside world as not only insane, but criminally insane.
‘Thank you, I was confused. Can we go back now?’ he said.
She smiled at this and responded, ‘Certainly, now take my hand. We’ll be returning to your home now.’


They, the strange woman and the very confused man, walked together in silence until the interfering man and the school were far in the background. The strange woman felt the anger of the man next to her, and waited for the explosion. They stopped at the entrance of a park he knew well. ‘In here,’ he demanded. He led her into the park and down a trail that led to a pavillion on the edge of a small lake. Taking a seat under the pavillion, and dropping his head into his hands, he asked ‘So what are you going to do? Follow me until one of us dies. Are you just going to go around lying and breaking every moral rule out there, just to follow me around? You simply cannot intrude on someone like this. It is immoral. It is sadistic. That is what it is, absolutely sadistic.’ He found his courage in the absence of her stare. ‘You have to stop this. You have no right.’
‘I think you are being bit senstive,’ she said.
‘You basically predicted where I was going to be today, and you did something dishonest to intrude on me. You basically trapped me. That’s what I am, trapped.’
She looked at him, only briefly. ‘If you only knew what it’s like. Whenever I see you, I know you’re going to be mean and rude, but that’s okay because I enjoy knowing that it’s you.’
His eyes sparked as he turned on her. ‘See! Do you see? You think that I am mean and rude, but I am not. You just assume you are right and that I am that simple. Not only are you wrong, but it is a lie. It is a lie that I would have to actually try and vindicate. So I am trapped into having a history that I regret with someone I would rather not know! Is there any greater need for anonymity than that?’


The two sat under the pavilion on the banks of the small lake that was now black under the early April sky. This was a fitting place to be at the moment, a place that captured the wet chill and visceral sense of exposure he felt. The school bell rang in the distance, sending a small flock of crows into the trees.
‘I should be in my second class right now,’ he said.
‘Well, what are your plans now?’ she asked.
He looked at her ‘I don’t know. Get a ticket and go home, I suppose. I really hope I get single house, one with plenty of alcohol.’
She responded, ‘Can I walk with you?’
‘Can I stop you?’ he asked. With that, he turned, left the cemetery, and headed for the nearest ticket station.


The ticket station resembled a small information booth, but instead of information pamphlets, it dispensed plastic tickets. He took one from the attending robotic genie's mouth and read it.
‘North Bath. Not a bad part of town. We will need to head to Washington and Elm.’ At the corner they drew a ticket from another booth. 
‘Paddington House. I think I have been there,’ he said.
She looked at him with a glint in her eye, ‘Me too,’ she said.
He responded, ‘Right, well, it should be right down the street here.’


They approached a three story Brownstone. It, like all other homes, was in fine shape. This one looked to be especially warm and inviting, just the kind of place to curl up in front of a fireplace with a glass of port, a good book, and forget about your stalker. 
‘Apartment 1, just inside the door. Well, I guess this is where I’ll leave you.’ he said. He entered the building, came to the first apartment on the left, and knocked. A few moments later the door opened with three shining faces beaming out at them.
‘Oh welcome, so glad you got here early! We were just in the middle of what was a most unfair pillow fight!’ To his horror, he had drawn a family apartment. ‘Excuse me, I think I arrived at the wrong house.’ He grabbed the handle and yanked the door shut in their faces. ‘I’ll just draw another ticket. That’s okay isn’t it?’ he convinced himself that it would be alright ‘just this once’. He was after all, having an identity crisis.


She was outside watching two birds forage in the front yard. ‘Still here, I see,’ he said.
‘How do you think birds tell each other apart?’ she asked.
‘Why do have to assume they do?’ he replied, ‘I refuse to stay there. I am going to draw tickets until I get a place where I can be alone.’
She looked at him, and for the first time, she was surprised with him. ‘That might take a while,’ she said. ‘As long as I get some peace and quiet,’ he said.
‘Well, I have a better idea. We will get you a nice lonely apartment in no time. Follow me.’ And without anything better to offer, he did.


They had only walked a few houses down before they stopped in front of another large Brownstone.


‘I bet there is an empty apartment in there,’ she said.
‘Is that your plan? Just walk in and squat on an apartment?’, but she was already headed up the front steps. 
She stopped at one of the front apartments on the top floor. The lights were off and the door was unlocked; in other words, ready for the next occupants. She stepped inside to have a look around, and came back a few moments later to say, 


‘This should do. Go ahead, I will go pull the card for it.’
‘You are unbelievable,’ he said. This, of course, did not stop him from hanging the overcoat in the front closet. She returned a few minutes later with card in hand.
‘So you just went to the ticket station and pulled the number?’
‘I do not think any one will be showing up,’ she giggled and hung her petticoat on a hook near the door.
‘What are you doing?’ he said, ‘You are not staying here.’
‘Oh come on now,’ she said, ‘We have a nice apartment of our own choosing and we are here with someone we know. This is like a dream.’
‘Wrong,’ he said, ‘This is a nightmare. I do not want to know anyone in particular; nobody does, except you. You, who thinks that birds spend their days trying to figure out who is who. Now, if you do not mind,’ he said.
‘But I do,’ she replied.
She said, as she removed her shoes and jacket, ‘Last night, after you left, I went to Fort Bacon and stayed in a squad bay. I spent the whole night trying to tell people apart. I realized that you are the only person I can recognize. Obviously, I cannot allow myself to lose the only person I know. Actually, I am surprised you would want the only person who knows you to think you have gone missing.’
He replied, ‘Well, I certainly cannot go missing if nobody knows me, now can I? It is only since you have come to think you know me, that I have become a potentially missing person. So here we are, in a premeditated domicile with a premediated choice of partner. What is next? How long are you going to follow me? You do know where they put people who think they are being recognized and people who think they can recognize other people?’


They both went silent, contemplating the possibility of being mistaken for lunatics*.


‘You do know what they do with loonies? They dress them differently, did you know that? And they keep them confined and locked up with other loonies. I hear the outfits they make you wear have numbers on them, so they can tell you apart!’


He was nervously pacing the kitchen and imagining every terrible thing that was going to result from their escapade. Perhaps those who entered the lottery to work at The White House would tattoo a number onto his forehead and plaster his photo in The Daily Bath. She was sitting on a bar stool, seated at the island, and staring into her bottle of black lager.


‘But I can prove that I can recognize you.’
He shrugged, ‘Even so, who would want to hear it? How do you know that half the people locked up in rainbow jumpers cannot do the same?’
She replied ‘People would not knowingly do that to sane people.’
‘Well, if you are alleging to identify people, nobody is going to think that you are sane,’ he continued, ‘Everyone around us is playing by the rules. Nobody meddles with the system. Now, along you come and start sticking your fingers in the dam. Well, I tell you, nobody wants to see the holes as long as they remain small.’
‘Are you not tired,’ she asked, ‘We have been at this a while and have gotten nowhere. I for one, am hungry.’
He chuckled and replied ‘Great, seeing as where are going to be companions for the foreseeable future, me trying to enjoy what is left of my life and you trying to stain it, that is what I will call you, Hungry.’
And so, the first name ever given to a Homo neutralis, was really no name at all. After all, names like Brian, Paul, and Jasmine Lynn would not have existed in an anonymous society. Naturally, words like hairy, merry, and promiscuous would have to suffice until proper names like Harry, Marry, and Chastity evolved.
‘Hungry, wow, I have a name!’
He thought he might have softened his sarcasm a bit too much. ‘Do you realize how frightening that would be to most people? Here you are, taking an adjective as a personal identifier.’
She looked rather proud of herself. ‘Maybe I should give you a name!’ she said enthusiastically.
‘Are you kidding?’ he said.
 ‘No,’ she said, ‘I am Hungry.’
He sighed, ‘I mean, have you forgotten that I am against this recklessness?’
She beamed with joy ‘But we will be the only two people with names!’
He cringed at the thought of it. ‘Suppose I refuse to call you Hungry. Maybe I will call you Crazy or Dangerous or nothing at all.’
‘Oh come now, Nothing at All’ would be a ridiculous name!’ she said.
‘Fine I will do you one better and call you Nothing et al. to accomodate your obvious psychoses!’


They ate dinner over a bottle chianti. She had a duck carpaccio with port reduction followed by a stack of anise crackers. He had a frozen sausage pizza followed by half a package of Happy Old Lady’s Chocolate Chip Cookies.


‘I love these cookies.’ He muttered through half a mouthful.
She prodded him, ‘How do you know that they were made by a happy old lady? With a package in nearly every house, I am sure that she is much more overworked than she is happy. Perhaps, that is what they should be called, Overworked Old Lady’s Chocolate Chip Cookies. Maybe then they would be less popular and she would not have to make so many. Maybe then she would be happy. Of course, she would have to name them Happy Old Lady’s Chocolate Chip Cookies once again. I suppose the entire ordeal would be a most unfortunate equilibrium.’
He stared at her, his mouth cocked open with a ballus of one of the happy overworked old lady’s confections rolling to the back of his throat. She was the first person that had ever made an impression on him. Indeed, outside the occassional catastrophe, no person in Homo neutralis society ever made an impression on anyone. Now, here was Hungry. Unlike anyone he had ever met, and all the more frightening for it, but also intriguing. ‘What would inspire someone to be so different?’ he asked himself. ‘What good is there in it?’
They finished dinner and retired to separate rooms, though she would have gladly followed him into his; she could not get enough of her new companion. She sat on the front terrace, imagining the possibilities of their new lives, the limitations of their old lives, and the opportunities ahead. Despite premedatatively occupying an apartment and defrauding the lottery the two were in no great deal of trouble. Actually, they were in no trouble at all. Their society had yet to anticipate this kind of behavior, nevertheless to interpret it as criminal.
        The next morning, Hungry awoke drenched in sweat beneath her tweed and cotton clothes. She only remembered fragments of the nightmare that had shocked her awake. The rest, she would rather forget.

‘Sir, you are much too short to ride this ride,’ the stick-thin rollercoaster operator ground out the sentence between rotted teeth and rotten breath. The man he addressed, despite wearing six-inch elevator shoes, was far below the minimum height limit for riding the Wheel of Fortune. This was clearly indicated by the cut-out photograph of Bazooko, the happy-happy circus clown. Bazooko’s hand was at least half a foot above the poor man’s sweat-beaded balding head. ‘Please, ma’am,’ the short balding man said, ‘let me sit on your lap.’ His rubbery outstreched arms snaked their way to her as she stared into his twinkling doe eyes. She felt a moments panic at the unfamiliar closeness of the desparate little leprechaun, but before she could cringe, he was gone, vanished, evaporated from an unconscious that swam in a psychedelic sea of circus lights, grease-painted faces, sawdust, and rusty dark corners.
        
‘Keep it moving!’ yelled the Wheel of Fortune operator. She, next in line, stepped-up. Though unaware of her feet or her body, her eyes floated over Bazooko’s hand and stopped at the operator. The tall man leaned in and hugged her with a cloud of whiskey vapors and cigar smoke, and with a slimy crooked grin that nearly slid from his sunken leather face, said through a double row of chipped and leaning tombstones ‘My dear, my dear, you will fit perfectly!’ He shoved her with a long wiry arm into the lead car of a scrapmetal rollercoaster. The car was painted fire-engine red and was dented, dinged, and nearly rusted through. Whatever bumpers and rubber safety guards had once been there were gone. Now, only rough metal edges waited to greet her arms and elbows in the centrifugal ride turned meat grinder.
The operator, who now resembled a maniacal geanie, whirled to his station and with hands raised and outstretched to providence, yelled ‘Draw a card. Take the ride!’ and brought down his hands by the weight of his body onto a steam furnace player piano. He grabbed and pulled at twisted bent levers and rusty vice-locking lever handles. These released a horrid cloud of yellow sulfur steam, that, if not for the orange haze of her aqueous humors and the wrenching aroma seeping up from where the previous rider had pleaded for life, would have occurred to her as foreboding omens. The operator-turned-genie lifted up one red and yellow striped leg and with a heaving kick, planted one flapping clown shoe on the piano. The auto-pneumatic lungs of the locomotive beast let out a wheeze and started the carriage rolling, bringing a sluggish metallic strain to the air. The notes quickened and gathered into a rendition of ‘Entry of the Gladiators’ that made her skin crawl and her mouth taste like copper. As the music quickened, the cars moved forward and climbed the outer circumference of the Wheel of Fortune, marking time as they hit against the chain that dragged them.
The car rose thirty, three hundred, three thousand feet above the circus and finally broke through the asphyxiating cloud of the drugged and drunken bazaar below. From these sobering heights she could see the bounds of the poisonous cloud and the dark country side that expanded beyond it. Moonlight gave illumination to hills and valleys and various roads leading into them. Each road radiated from the hellish spectacle below, or perhaps, led to it. From within the valleys she could see the brilliant twinklings of villages, their homes and shops still alight with business. Who were the people that lived there? What did they look like and what did they do? Did they all look and act alike? The car stopped climbing.
She felt her guts hang onto their sinews as she floated for a housefly’s half-hour.
Charming thoughts of the far off villages vanished as she breached the Wheel’s highpoint and lost the reins of her anxiety. As the car descended, each organ pulled on the others as they crashed against her diaphragm and struck the keys of her ribs. The car dropped and she let loose a curdling scream into the vacuous heavens above the sulfurous cloud into which she began to descend. She wrenched her hands onto ragged metal edges and pulled with all might and force to keep herself inside. The car lurched forward even as it descended, drug by the dog chain arm of some mechanical Leviathan. The car entered a teetering tunnel of wooden planks and circus penants. Flickering miners lights sped by as she descended down the ghost ship mine shaft with her eyes wide open and her face paralyzed.
‘A rose by any other name would still die in the street, he, he, he,’ came the geanie’s voice. Ghostly visages and perverted wrathes of all rotten and diseased kinds raced towards her. Toothless old men in the grips of orgasm. Blistered young women in fits of infanticidal rage. Greedy greasy naked men with golden boils and bad comb-overs prostituting the zombies to an emaciated audience.
  
‘Stooooop!’ came her reply.
‘Stop? Stop what? There is only one way back down ma’am. You have no choice but to hang on,’ came the geanie’s reply.
‘Please stop this!’ came her plea.
‘If I stop it now, you will be catapulted straight into the Tilt-O-whirl! Best to just ride it out!’
No matter how hard she tried, she could not close her eyes. For fear of falling out, she could not cover her ears. She was forced to live through this ride.
The car entered a nauseating cloud of pink and orange and yellow smoke. The vapors of different colors were thick like colored oils and swirled and mingled as if blended on the cotton candy machine and stretched on the taffy puller.
‘Your children will feast on your corpse as your dead eyes stare into the empty sockets of an anonymous lover.’ She woke, with dripping sweat.

Sitting up, she rubbed the inside corners of her eyes to remove the cotton candy crust. She stretched her arms to the ceiling and behind her back, releasing a tail of orange vapor that had gotten stuck in her armpit on her descent through the Wheel of Fortune mine shaft. ‘Oh boy, I need a shower. I wonder what time it is?’ 

It was 10:30 in the a.m. The flies were out seeking breakfast, the Blackbirds were out seeking flies, and two miles away, the old knightly oak was cursing the promiscuous Blackbirds. She rose and stretched in the light that was now beaming through the patio doors. Leaning her head forward and off her center of gravity, she swayed in the direction of the bathroom and with an inverted pendular momentum, took her first staggered steps towards the shower. If a fly were following her, honing in on the stench of turpentine and sweat and looking for a place off which to sop and sponge its breakfast, it would have had as hard a time following her as we might have had following it. Her feet hit the cold stone of the bathroom and sealed to it with a layer of sweaty adhesive. With each step, she lifted her leg from the floor faster than what the skin of her sole could manage to release.

She closed the bathroom door and immediately felt as if she were the grimiest thing inside. She stopped and turned to look into the mirror that formed one door of the shower. She felt greasy at all joints and if it were not for the feeling of being equally grimy she would have considered herself, well-oiled. She unbuttoned the musky tunic that had once been her suit jacket. The fine tweed had been reduced to a coarse wool and now gripped at her arms, refusing to let go. She tossed it in the corner of the bathroom after peeling it off, and began to unbutton her sour smelling linen blouse. ‘What in the world happened to me last night?’ she wondered.

She stood in front of the shower mirror, naked and feeling ragged. She turned in the mirror and inspected herself. She had no pimples, no blemishes, no scars, and no bruises. She had no rolls of excess fat to accentuate her abdomen and hips, no dimples of cellulite to draw his eye to her thighs, and no toes of odd length nor teeth of odd size. Each eye orbited at the same height as the other and both worked in perfect synchrony. Gravity had pulled each buttock with the same force and each buttock fought gravity with the same resilience. Each breast hung in perfect symmetry with the other and each nipple was poised ever so slightly upwards. The uppermost of her inner thighs bisected a perfect triangle. She was perfectly symmetrical from side-to-side. ‘Boring,’ she said to herself as she stepped into the shower.
She emerged from the shower thirty minutes later. Her skin was pink from heat of the shower and taught from hitting the cool Spring air that had entered throught the bathroom window. ‘Wow, that feels amazing!’ she said aloud. ‘I hope you are up for an eventful day!’ she shouted. She wrapped a towell around her hair, and in a brazen move, walked naked from the bathroom to what was supposed to be her bedroom. She opened the closet and found, as she expected, a full rack of ready-to-wear outfits. They were, of course, identical but many times cleaner than the clothes she had removed. She dressed quickly but without closing the door. Dressing slowly is difficult when you have worn the same outfit for 28 years. After the first three weeks, you basically just throw it on. She selected a new pair of black patent leather high-heels. They were, of course, the only style available. Having dressed, she returned to the bathroom to dry her hair and put on her face. She passed his room on the way and greeted him, ‘Good morning, sleepy head!’. He, apparently having had one too many beers last night, did not respond. ‘I said, good morning sleepy head,’ and she poked her head through his bedroom door. He was not there. She was only a bit worried by this, ‘He wouldn’t leave me,’ she said, ‘not without saying something.’
