With respect to social contract theory, the conceptual framework of these theories is built on an assumption of per captia equivalence (i.e equal opportunity) and the lack of any exploitative advantage (overt competition). The mathematical framework of these theories use these concepts by relying on a probabilistic and memoryless sampling process, i.e. a lottery.
