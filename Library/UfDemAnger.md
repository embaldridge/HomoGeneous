They spread a patchwork quilt on the slope of lawn pouring out from beneath a patch of tulip garden and laid down to watch the clouds metamorphose from whispy tadpoles into lumpy toads. Any lazy-day naturalist would have a full career ahead of him if he chose to study these Bufo nebulus1. From his back the natural historian of B. nebulus could observe the Cloud toad in its natural habitat. On a rainy day, the natural historian would observe how Cloud toads reproduced by bursting into a billion or more eggs, each of which falls to Earth and lands in a puddle. There, each egg hatches and, through harnessing the power of the sun, swims to the surface of its puddle, breaks free from the meniscus, and swims directly upwards into the stratosphere. There, each nubile quickly grows a whispy tail and devours the insects and birds around it. The natural historian would also note the tendency of the small tadpoles to hide among the clouds. This was their only defense against the large and cannibalistic adults. After all, there was no sense in trying to mimic a Poison-dart frog or something inedible like a mossy stone, both which, are either arboreal or terrestrial and are clearly not aerial. Indeed, the best chance of survival any juvenile Cloud toad has, is to mimic a cloud.


1. I, your author, am the discoverer of this species but have yet to conclude where it fits most parsimoniously on the amphibian tree. I adopted the genus Bufo as I believe the Cloud toad to indeed be a ‘true toad’. B. nebulus is a relatively new species that has surpassed the water-to-land transition with a water-to-air transition. As large toads have been noted to prey on small birds and as the atmosphere held countless flying arthropods as well as birds, the sky was a natural expansion of the amphibian niche. Molecular analysis of its DNA has been confounded by the accumulation of aerosols, industrial particulates, and unnaturally high levels of gases with a high specific heat. Like many other amphibians, and especially the anurans, B. nebulus is at especially high risk of extinction due to man-caused pollution. 


‘Oh, a toad was just disintegrated by the sun!’ Hungry giggled.
‘The circle of life, my dear Hungry,’ said her companion.
‘Do you think any two Cloud toads have ever been identical?’ she asked.
‘There is almost an infinite number of ways two could vary,’ he answered.
‘Do you think they burst into a trillion eggs right after mating?’ she asked.
‘I have seen two of them mating already, and have not felt a single drop,’ he answered.
‘Do you think the males gather in groups to announce their eligibilty in chorus?’ he asked.
‘I suppose it would make sense,’ she answered ‘The sky is an awfully large place to be going about the business of courtship all on one’s own.’
‘So is a park,’ he replied, and pointed to a group of young men and the group of young women to whom they advertised. Unlike the competitive leks of Lesser-prairie chickens and Common Grackles, this group of eager young men formed a lottery of their own.

A small circle of women had grown in the shade of a willow on the banks of a duck pond. The ring of pale violets swayed in the April breeze to the whispers of Athena. The wind brushed back the violets’ linen petals revealing that, unbeknown to most, violets possess collarbones and the elegant necks of swans. The flowers speak of their wariness and weariness of young men, who to them, appear as goats with flattened inhuman horizontal pupils and loud unintelligent voices. The violets would rather be in their own company, and in that of the water lilies and lily pads. However, the violets are mistaken. The young men are not goats, they are bullfrogs.
        
Out from the group of noisy bullfrogs, jumps a daring male. The young bullfrog entertains the rest with a lymeric that sends up of a chorus of laughter. Having made his attempt to attract the violets, he then ducks back inside the group and is lost within it. Another young frog, indistinguishable from the first, leaps from the group and executes a series of side leaps, pirouettes, and finishes with a line of Chaîné turns. All the frogs cheer and envelope him. The violets turn their heads to the frogs, interested to see what was to come next. Out jumps another, and with graceful gestures and eccentuated leans and bows, he orates a poem of some ancient uknown origin:


        Were all the world mine
        from the sea to the Rhine,
        I would starve myself of it
        so that the Queen of England
        might lie in my arms!2


2.The tenth carmen, Were diu werlt alle min—If I ruled all the world    

The frog smiles at the violets, and with outstretched hand and utmost gentility, invites them over. One of the impressed flowers uproots, leaves her floral sorority, and approaches the band of bullfrogs.


‘Please ma’am,’ says one of the frogs, ‘keep our friend company. He is distressed by his superior abilities and intelligence. The poor fellow is a wreck over it.’ 
‘Oh dear, please, let me talk to him. I am sure he has nothing to fear, since I can detect no difference among any of you.’


The group sends out its candidate and the frog and flower walk off together. Another frog, then joins the group, which continues its performance.


‘You have got to be kidding me,’ says Hungry, ‘That really works?’
‘Certainly,’ says her bullfrog, ‘The group draws straws and then cooperates to win over the ladies one by one. They all pull for one man and then replenish their numbers.’
‘That is positively unscrupulous!’ says Hungry.
Her bullfrog adds, ‘Just because all men look and act identically does not mean that any young lady is ready to die for anyone of them. Indeed, who would want to die just to have sex with a man who is but a drop in the bucket? True, any woman may as well mate with any man since all men are alike and equally eager, but if that is the case, then any woman might as well wait as long as she can.’
‘But what about the men?’ asks Hungry.
‘They are more than likely, older than you think them to be.’ replied her frog.
        From their blanket, Hungry spotted a pair of Mute swans. The two have staked this lake as their home each year for the past five years. They have made preparations for another brood by gathering cattails, twigs, and stems of bullrush into an enslosure of downed reeds that was large enough to hold a sleeping full grown man. Hungry calls his attention to them, ‘Look, do you see the swans? Are they not beautiful?’ she says.
‘Incredibly,’ he responds, ‘Did you know that they pair for life?’
‘I do,’ replied Hungry, ‘And they return to the same place each year to produce another nest and another brood. Can you imagine what that must be like?’
‘Hardly,’ he responds, ‘To have one’s life ruled by repeatedly having to mate and have offspring. To repeatedly have to rear another group of them? I think that it might just best to live your life and then, when you are good and ready, have kids and leave the world having lived a full and happy life.’
‘Well, I think that it is a bit unfortunate,’ said Hungry.
‘Why so?’ he asked.
‘Well,’ she began,
‘Just take the swans, for instance. They spend most of their lives with a mate. They travel with them and are never alone. If one gets lost they both get lost and become lost together, which has got to be better than being lost on one’s own. Each member of every pair has another swan to look after it and each swan has another swan that it can call its own. You can see how the male swan guards his female and protects her, and if you wait a few weeks, you can see how both of them guard and protect their swanlings. Can you imagine the affection they must have for each other?’
‘Did you know that it is almost impossible to tell the males from the females?’ she asked.
‘No, but I can see why,’ he answered ‘I don’t think I could even tell one male from another, not that you often see two male Mute swans in the same place. Clearly, the males and females can sort themselves out, and I imagine that each sex can see a member of it’s own coming from halfway across the water.’
‘Suppose Mute swans were like humans,’ said Hungry, ‘and that they couldn’t recognize other Mute swans. How would they remain paired for life?’
‘I suppose they would have reproduce once and die shortly afterwords.’ came his reply. ‘Way to kill a moment,’ said Hungry
