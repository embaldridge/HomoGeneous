#The Lunatic Fringe


‘To conclude, the tavern will compare favorably with the church. The church is the place where prayers and sermons are delivered, but the tavern is where they are to take effect…’—Henry David Thoreau


‘Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves coverings.’ These words boomed from the high pulpit and ricocheted off the far side of the arcade. The Prophet wrenched onto his podium, braced himself by the edges of his palms, and readied himself to pontificate on the evils of neutrality, equality, and lottery. ‘This society wants you abstain from notions of individual agenda and renounce your right to take the advantage. It wants you to renounce your self-interest lest you supplant a person from their station. In the uterus, where individual freedom is first born into confinement, this society plants another seed, that all men are created equal. Equal in right to happiness. Equal in right to opportunity!’ A spring of boohs and jeers broke the earth beneath their feet and flooded the room. ‘Well,’ continued The Prophet. ‘I know for a fact that not all are created equal.’ 
And he read from his notes ‘To the woman the Universe said, “I will give you pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children. Your desire shall be for a man, and he shall rule over you.” You see, brothers, the Universe has cursed women into subserviant positions. Forever, they must wash soiled linens and feed men in high chairs! Show me the woman who has a painless birth, who does not groan in labor while a man slips quietly into a post coital death. This, I am sorry to say, is a raw deal dealt by a raw Universe! And, as I always say, “When it comes down to just you and the Universe, one person’s raw deal is another’s lucky hand!” ‘ The men cheered again. The Prophet did not cease his attack on equality with demanding the sublimation of women. ‘And I know for a fact that not all people remain equal!’ He read, “Nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the Universe!” This brought a lump to the throat of Pissed Drunk as he lay motionless in his bed, upstairs from the fire and brimstone smoldering below.
‘Hey, what the?’ said Very Confused, ‘I am tied to my damn bed!’
‘Son of bitch!’ shouted Piss Drunk, ‘We both are.’
‘What is going on down there?’ whispered Very Confused.
‘I don’t know,’ replied Pissed Drunk, ‘but, whatever this place is, it’s no bar’. We must have wandered into the damn Lunatic nest!’
From below, they heard the speaker direct his rabble towards them.
‘And right now, as I stand and speak, two drunkards, two low-down swindlin’ revilers are upstairs. No doubt, their pointed ears, like those of the skulking fox, are tuned a perceived threat.’ 
The two companions looked at each other in horror, not a word escaped them. Had they been in possession of a full set of working auricularis muscles, they would have been tuned-in to every word. As it were, they were not, and so, turned to attempts to free themselves. Fortunately, the crazy Lunatics had not thought to tie them to their beds and had only bound their hands and feet.


‘And no doubt, their hearts like that of the thievin’ rodent are beating fast as their black eyes become paralyzed with fear at some impending doom.’ Fibrilating hearts and fear paralysis, check. ‘And no doubt, that if we were quiet enough, we might hear the click-clack of their cloven hooves on the floor above as they, like the dark figure Old Scratch himself, sneak through an upstairs window.’ 


Fortunately for Piss Drunk and Very Confused, the lunatics were not so quiet and did not hear the two very confused and piss drunk companions hop for the nearest window, pillows in bounded hands. Away to the window they flew like a flash (well kind of), tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.


‘Stupid sashes,’ said Piss Drunk, ‘What on Earth are they even for?’

The moon on the breast of a mid-April snow, gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below. When what to their wondering eyes should appear, but a twenty foot drop cushioned only by fear. With all the bravery that comes from an intoxicated sense of self-preservation, they took a leap of faith on what they hoped would only be a deep and soft pile of garbage. They quickly found a rugged piece of pipe to cut the ropes that bound them. 


‘They’ve got Hungry in there somewhere,’ said Very Confused, ‘We can’t leave her.’
‘We’ll get her back. C’mon, lets go see what they’re doing downstairs,’ replied Piss Drunk.


They rushed around to the front of the Tavern. No Lunatics present. They took up position from the outside windows. They could see the crowd of lunatics. They saw the Prophet speaking and the men responding. He pounded his fists on the podium and they applauded. He shook his arms with clenched fists and they jeered. He was a maestro and they were his orchestra. The Prophet, then, pulled back the curtain he had been standing in front of.


‘Hungry!’ shouted Very Confused’
‘Keep it down, man. You’ll give us away,’ warned Piss Drunk.


As far as they could tell, she was not bound or gagged but was simply standing there, expressionless. Instead, she was stood limp in bright ceremonial garb, as if waiting for the pomp and circumstance of a ritual execution.


Stetit puella*        A girl stood
rufa tunica;                in a red tunic;
si quis eam tetigit,        if anyone touched it,
tunica crepuit.        the tunic rustled.
Eia.        Eia!
Stetit puella        A girl stood
tamquam rosula;        like a little rose:
facie splenduit,                        her face was radiant
os eius fioruit.                        and her mouth in bloom.
Eia.                Eia!


*The 17th Carmen, Steti puella.


The crowd of men cheered for The Prophet, the first man to take a wife. Soon, they would all take wives and be fed in high chairs. 





Hungry stood there, emotionless and unresponsive. Looking around at the room of crazed men, she realized that beneath the congenial and equittable society were the apes they all thought they had evolved from. Indeed, the ape was waiting behind identical masks all the while. ‘Is this what men resort to when they are made to believe that each man is an island?1 Is this what people become when they tear-up an equittable social contract and seek the advantage over one another?2 Is society, even a neutral society, so fragile that in the span of two weeks, a single dissapointed man could have such an effect?3 Was The Prophet really that gifted, or was he just tapping-in to what all these men had been supressing all the while?4 And, what are Piss Drunk and Very Confused doing outside when they should be being held captive upstairs?’

1. Apparently
2. Hard to believe, huh?
3. Nope, as will be shown, the neutral society, as an equlibrium stable strategy, tolerates this kind of disturbance and returns to equilibrium.
4. He is totally tapping-in, which is just another way of saying that he is exploiting a weakness of the men. The Prophet is a lunatic, so he’s still coloring inside his own lines.
‘Very Confused and Piss Drunk!’ she shrieked.
The Prophet turned and saw them too. ‘Get them!’ he yelled to his minions.


‘C’mon!,’ said Piss Drunk ‘The time for war is at hand!’

The two men raced inside the tavern before the mob could exit. The two brave compatriots, willing to die to save their Hungry, readied their pillows. A wave of Lunatics hit the hallway entrance and broke on the shore of it. The Lunatics filed two-by-two down the narrow corridor; they had no pillows. In the narrow hallway the superior numbers of the weaponless Lunatics counted for nothing. The first one down let out a blood curdling war cry, but Piss Drunk blocked it and, with his extra-firm memory foam mace, swung low to catch the man beneath the chin. The man’s feet left the ground and were quickly followed by those of his companion; laid low by the body pillow of Very Confused. For lack of pillows, any training in hand-to-hand combat, and no real desire to physically hurt anybody, the Lunatics fell like dominos. Very Confused and Piss Drunk made short work of the hench-men Lunatics, and in reaching the tavern sanctum, shut the door to keep the noisy bastards from getting back in.


‘Hungry!’ cried Very Confused.
‘Very Confused!’ cried Hungry.
‘Watch out!’ cried Piss Drunk.
‘Aaaahhh!’ cried The Prophet.

Actually, that is all The Prophet did. Sure, it was awfully hard to bear, seeing a grown man screaming and crying, and it probably did a bit of inner ear damage to all four, but he posed no real threat. 


‘You have got to be kidding me!?’ yelled The Prophet.
‘There is nothing funny about kidnapping’ said Very Confused.
‘What are you talking about? We are getting married, here. Now, if you don’t mind!’ shouted The Prophet.
‘What?’ said Very Confused.
‘Come again,’ said Piss Drunk.
‘Married’ said Very Confused, ‘and what praytell is that?’
‘Oh, well,’ said The Prophet, ‘It’s just a thing I came up with. You see, if a man likes a woman, he can take her for his own. They become bound to each other through a social contract where the man has to ensure the woman’s safety and the woman has to feed the man in a high chair.’


‘Well, I do mind,’ said Hungry, ‘I have no intention of marrying you. Why would I ever marry a complete and utter Lunatic?’
‘Well,’ said The Prophet, ‘That isn’t your choice, dear. The Universe says so. You will just have to trust me. That’s what marriage is based on.’
‘I hate to dissapoint you Prophet, but you are not marrying anyone today,’ said Very Confused.
Very Confused extended his hand to Hungry.
‘Let’s go, Hungry. Let’s get out of here.’ 

However, before the three comrades could take their first steps towards a life of happily ever afterness, The Prophet bent down and picked up the heavy body pillow. ‘Not so fast!’ he screamed. Very Confused turned in time to duck the wild swing, but Hungry did not. The pillow caught her under the nose and sent up a stream of crimson. She dropped and lay dazed and holding her face as it gushed.


‘Hungry!’ screamed Very Confused as he dropped to her side, ‘Oh no, oh no!’
‘What are you thinkin, man!’ yelled Piss Drunk. He snatched the pillow away from The Prophet and commenced to beat him silly with it.
‘Very Confused, very confused, it hurts.’ She moaned.
‘Stay with me Hungry, stay with me.’ Very Confused pleaded.
‘This is all my fault,’ said Hungry, ‘If I had not drug you into this.’
‘Oh my Hungry. It’s all my fault. I’m so sorry for everything.’

Dulcissime,        Sweetest one! Ah!
totam tibi subdo me!        I give myself to you totally!
