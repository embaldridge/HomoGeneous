#Veni, veni, venias!

‘Hello, hello, are you okay?’ came a voice. She awoke in a soft quilted bed. Her eyes slowly opened to an amber light and gentle voice. She roused drowsily to their call. Overcoming her desire to remain asleep, she pushed with her shoulders against a mattress that only yielded to her efforts. She emptied her weight into her hands and forehead, and pushing off, brought her torso upright and separated it from her hips and legs. They had slept with the rest of her but now refused to wake on her command. Gradually coming to her senses, she looked around from some clue of where she was. The room was small but welcoming. It was only three or four times larger than the bed from which she surveyed, and an additional third was taken by book shelves. Maps of stars and galaxies adorned the ceiling and were strung together with garlands of yarn that connected points of interest like the framing of a rose window. The walls were decorated with the portraits of men and women with never before seen appearances. Poems and sonnets were written in the spaces between the works of this curious gallery, but the dim light kept them hidden; kept them quiet. She smelled hot chocolate and gingerbread.
        
‘Hi there,’ came a voice. She turned and saw man by her bed-side. This man looked like no other man that she had ever seen. He wore glasses and had tousled hair. He wore a suit of common aire, but wore it with the cuffs and pants rolled-up. He wore no shoes, but let his feet roam free. He had no tie and his button-up shirt was buttoned-downed two buttons. ‘Weird huh?’ he said, ‘Ever think you would see someone who looked like me?’ Indeed, she never had. Who was this man who chose to stick-out so plainly? He seemed so perfectly at home with his descrepancies. Was he suffering from an identity crisis? He did not seem confused though. In fact, he seemed quite at peace with his differences. ‘Who are you?’, Hungy asked. She was amazed at this because she had never asked this question before; there was never any reason to. Now, with the man sitting in front of her who had clearly meant to distinguish himself, she wondered who he thought he was.


‘I am The Prophet,’ said the man.
‘Wow!’ said Hungry ‘You have a name? So do I!’
I know, said the man, ‘Your name is Venus.’
‘No, I am Hungry,’ said Hungry.
‘Yes, I am sure,’ said The Prophet.

The two threw each other awkward looks, but disregarded what they felt was a complete miscommunication.


‘The Prophet?’ asked Hungry ‘What does that mean?’
‘Well,’ said the man, ‘I have determined that it means “he who profits”.’
‘Wow!,’ said Hungry, ‘You made up a word, gave it a definition, and then took it as a name.’
‘I did, indeed,’ said the Prophet, ‘I even took a name from the Universe and gave it to you.’
‘Uh, right,’ said Hungry, ‘I guess I could always use another.’

The two threw each other the same awkward looks, but again, disregarded the odd interaction.


‘I brought some hot chocolate and gingersnaps for you to eat, Venus,’ said the man.
‘Mmm, it smells delicious,’ and she took them and ate and drank as if she was starving.


‘Venus,’ said The Prophet ‘Venus,’.
Hungry looked up at The Prophet. ‘Yes?’ she said.
‘I thought you might like to know why you are here,’ said the Prophet.
‘Uh huh,’ said Hungry.
‘Two weeks ago,’ began the Prophet, ‘I was subjected to an inexplicable series of unfortunate lottery results. “This,” I said, “was no random series of equittable events.” I quickly realized that the Universe didn’t like me. I realized that I didn’t so much like it, either. But then, what was one man going to do to defend himself against the Universe? I realized that the Universe was nothing but a bully, a hot bag of wind.’


‘On the contrary,’ said Hungry, ‘The universe is a largely cold and windless place. Suns and solar winds make up only a very small part of it.’

‘Okay, then,’ said The Prophet, ‘For conversation sake and to keep things rolling let’s just say that, yes, the Universe is a cold and largely empty place. It does just as well. Anyway, there I was, standing in the street with the most unfortunate series of draws any person had ever drew. I had no explanation for why it happened, other than, the Universe was a bully. I realized though, that the Universe was completely unprepared to back-up its harrassment. I realized that if one chose to face it down, the Universe would turn and run away. So, I refused to eat what the Universe had ordered for me, the greasy plate of mustard stains it had served me, and I stayed where I wanted.’


‘Ooh, I have done that!’ said Hungry, ‘It is so liberating!’
‘Indeed, Venus, it was,’ replied The Prophet. ‘But that wasn’t it. That was not the epiphany I had which was to lead us to this very moment in time.’
Hungry’s eyes grew large, anticipating his story.

Disregarding the lottery for something so trivial as a place to sleep was liberating, but I was not liberated. I was still a mouse that had to sneek into the kitchen for a scrap of something to eat. I felt ashamed of working in the dark, like some cochroach or rat, to live as I wished. I am a person with feelings and desires, for Universe sake, and I will not yield to a neutered social contract. I began to do as I pleased in plain sight. People were shocked when I started wearing glasses and stopped parting my hair. They balked when I rolled up my cuffs and pants, and roamed around barefoot. Some even asked me what was wrong, whether I was suffering from an identity crisis. To each one I calmly responded, “The Universe doesn’t like you, but I do. Come and follow me, and I will support your desire to do as please.” A lot of people began following me, literally. It was a bit creepy, but all of them were wanting a chance to live outside neutrality; to test their mettle against the Universe.’


‘When you say, Universe, are you talking about the totality of physical existence?’ asked Hungry.


‘In a way, Venus, everything in the Universe is connected; nothing is absolutely separated either physically or causally from anything else. It is precisely because of that, that no such thing as pure random chance exists. Coin flips, rolls of die, ticket draws, and every single lottery known to man can be influenced and is influenced by everything else in the Universe. Given that nothing is completely unbiased, there exists a universal bias in the Universe that is exclusive to it and only it, this universal bias of the Universe, is the complete totality of all connected and concerted bias in the Universe. To simplify things, the Universe is aware and it does not like us. Even those it seems to like, eventually get betrayed. The Universe cannot help but to butt its nose in or to pee in our swimming pool. Surely then, with the deck clearly stacked against us, why would we ever concede to gamble in a crooked house when would could gambol in a field of dreams?’


‘You’re a Lunatic!’ screamed Hungry, ‘Why didn’t I see it!?’
‘Wait, what?’ said The Prophet, ‘I thought that was clear?’
‘No, it was not!’ shouted Hungry, ‘Now, let me go!’
‘Whoa,’ said the Prophet, ‘Just calm down. You are not here for me to hurt you.’

Hungry panicked. This was man responsible for spreading ideas about social disorder and mayhem. Sure, she may have broke the rules once or twice, but she still believed in the fundamental benefit of a neutral society. This guy actually thought that a system that gives everyone a fare chance, and a society that wants everyone to have a fair chance, was unfair. What were his plans? Why was she there? Had he not revealed himself as the architypal lunatic, she might have liked him.

‘Then, what did you bring me here for, he who believes so much in individual freedom but kidnaps a helpless woman?’
‘Huh,’ thought The Prophet, ‘I never thought of that.’
‘Well, I guess I take what Universe fails to give up. Seeing that you are part of the Universe, I have taken you.’
‘But,’ said Hungry ‘You are part of the universe. Therefore, you are part of the very bias that you think is working against you. Furthermore, the more you affect me and everybody else, the more you affect the different pieces of the Universe to which the universal bias belongs. You are clearly and inevittably working against yourself. Perhaps, you should just leave it in the hands of the lotteries?’
‘Ha!’ said The Prophet, ‘I did not understand a single word of what you just said. It seems that you are a natural lunatic!’
‘Except for the part about the Universe being a sentient bully. Oh, and the part where everybody gets to do whatever they wish, including disadvantaging others. Yeah, I guess I’m all for a person going around barefooted or sockfooted or just not trying to fit-in.’ replied Hungry.


(They argue. The Prophet, ever oblivious, plans to marry Hungry. Marry, another word he made up. She is black-mailed because The Prophet has captured her friends.)
