# A Workers' Movement

The man turned Prophet woke and saw his world through a new lens. 
"No lotteries today. If I want something, I’ll take it. If I want a house, I’ll claim it." he said to himself, as he inspected himself for discrepancies.
        
Determined to turn a long due profit, The Prophet set out early to shake loose change from the pockets of a greedy willy-nilly Universe. He made the bed, took out the garbage, cleaned the dishes, swept the floors, scrubbed the tub and toilet, folded the loose end of the toilet paper into a neat point, and placed a mint on the bed pillow for the next inhabitant. Despite deciding to ignore the lotteries, he did not intend to endorse chaos.

The Prophet rode a bike towards the river wharf and mill district. The gristmill, sawmill, and brewery were, as was common knowledge, predominated by men. It was no secret that the work took a certain physical strength. Females rarely entered lotteries for mill work. This created a bias in Bath as far as which sex one might expect to find performing which jobs. The Prophet new how he could use this bias to raise an army among the log drivers and sawmill workers, pit wheel operators, brewers, and slipper men. The millworkers should be taking lunch right about now.
        
The wharf and mill district was quartered by the intersection of Ash Street and Bulker, and further split by brickwall alley-ways. It lay south of the business district and markets, and lay on the north bank of the Cohocton River, across which logs were rolled down from Mossy Bank. Bath, being a small town of mere few thousand was far from being an industrial hub and far from being a noisy, grinding, mechanical nightmare of rusting trains and train tracks. Lumber, grain, and brew were pulled into town on drays by shires horses, and they only had to pull for a mere mile or so to get them there. The mill district was not the sooty, scrap littered metal yards that one might see in the industrial parks of a modern *Homo sapiens* city, but was at worst, a cluster of old brick buildings and muddy cobble streets.

The main point of reference to the mill district was the eight sails of two windmills that drove the gristmill and sawmill. The sails, nearly twenty metres or more in length, were attached to the windshaft of six story tower mills. Each mill was made of brick and stone and was skirted on the fourth level by a deck that allowed access to the cap and its machinery. Each of the two mills faced the shallow river. The three story mill buildings extended nearly to Ash Street, across from which, were the lumber yards and silos.

The brewery stood west of Bulker and a stone's throw from the mills. The brewery was the third highest structure in Bath. From the top floor of the six floor building a rat could eat it's fill of grain in the brewery attic, descend the planks and ropes of the brick walls, squeak past the rough cut rafters and floor boards of fifth and fourth floors where the grain gets mashed, and, if it made it past the steaming vats of the third and second floors without being killed, it could sip from spilt remains of newly boiled brew that's ready to be racked and fermented.

The Prophet rode down Ash, turned onto Debaucher, and came to a building the size of a one-room schoolhouse. Inside, the millworkers and brewers were enjoying their lunch and the smell of freshly planed wood. The Prophet leaned his bike against its side and entered the building. He walked past the tables of men and up onto a small raised stage that was normally used for town hall meetings. A few men noticed, but most kept eating.

The Prophet spoke, "Three men walk into a pub and spy the last two women left alive at the end of the bar. Given the number of men and women, and the need to perpetuate our species, the men decide to draw straws to see who will get the first opportunity to address the women. While two will get first dibs, one must wait for one of the other two to fail to impress. What does the poor unlucky guy do?" Thirty men now looked up from their lunches. Most looked less than impressed.

"Well, does one of you have an answer?” asked The Prophet.
"He should wait his damn turn!" came a shout.
"Fair’s fair." said another, "He’ll get another chance before long, since one of the other two is bound to embarrass himself."
The men let out round of laughter.

"Well, let’s suppose one does fail and opens the door to the other," said The Prophet. "Does the man that just failed get to draw against the man-out or does the man out simply get to try his luck with the un-impressed lady?"

"He get’s his due chance!" said one man. "The man out shouldn’t need to draw against a man that just had his fair chance and blew it." said another.

"So you all suggest that the men just rotate until one of them pushes the right buttons?"

"That's right." said the men in near unison.

"Well let me ask you this," said The Prophet, "Say this goes on for ten more rounds, with one man failing and getting replaced by another. Let’s say the man with lady number two never fails but simply holds her attention. Meanwhile, lady number one is forced to put up with the same two men vying in-turn for her attention because she doesn't want to leave her friend's company. This means that if the two friends working on lady number one have had equal amounts of time, the friend with lady number two has had twice as much time as either of his two friends, averaged together. 

Now, let’s say that in the eleventh round, lady two gets bored with the man who was, up until now, able to hold her attention. At this point there are two available ladies. By your logic, the man who was just out should get a chance with lady he wasn’t with last time, right? Let’s say they hit it off, and leave the tavern. One lady left on planet Earth. By your logic, the friend that was with lady opposite the one now taken should have his chance, correct?’

The men agreed, but sensed that they were being led into a trap.
‘Then, I ask you this. One man has had twice as long as the other, but has not been with the lady in-waiting. The other friend was just with her, but has only had half the time as the other. Who goes? Do they flip for it?
‘Well, one of’em has had twice as much time as the other, the man with less time should go. That’s why we started the whole rotation to begin with,’ one man shouted.
Some of the men sent up their support.
‘Wait a minute now,’ said another man, ‘The other man has just had his chance with that lady and has had many chances with her, but failed. The man with more time that has not been with her should go. I thought we agreed on the rotation plan to make sure that each man gets a fair amount of turns, not time. The man with more time has only had one turn.’
Again, some of the men, different one’s now, sent up their support.
‘Who care how many turns he’s had, he’s been in the entire damn time!’ said another man.
‘They could flip a coin for it!’ said one man.
‘A fair coin flip makes for a fair coin flip and nothin’ more!’ replied another.
‘Stop the insanity!’ cried another, ‘She just a woman!’
‘That ain’t the point!’ yelled another, ‘Ye big baby!’
The crowd grew louder and the disagreements grew more heated. What started as two men with two differing opinions, grew into two groups with two differing opinions, and that grew into four groups with four opinions. ‘Before long, each man will be arguing with every other! This is too easy!’ The Prophet thought to himself. He took a staff from the corner and loudly stamped it onto the floor, breaking the arguments and getting the men’s attention.
‘Well,’ asked the Prophet, ‘What’s your answer?’
‘Aye, t’aint no solution to that problem, not without opinion.’ said a man.
‘Aye,’ said the rest of them.
‘Well, you do agree that the situation could actually happen?’ asked The Prophet.
‘Aye,’ said the men.
‘And do you think
‘And at being unable to find an equittable solution, I imagine that each of you, if you were one of the two unfortunate men, would simply tip your hat to the last lady on Earth and forfeit?’ The men were silent.
‘So, presuming there’s no backing out, what do you do?’
The Prophet, scanned his audience. He looked into each of their eyes, and each them looked into his, waiting for the answer. After all, who would start such a rouse without a reason for it? Who would ask such a question without having an answer in his bullpen? The Prophet enjoyed this attention, he had stepped straight out of obscurity, into the fronts of their minds, and drove his heel deep into their psyche. Now, all he had to do was sew it up.
‘Might I suggest a solution, gentlemen?’ the Prophet asked.
‘Aye,’ said the men.
‘Well,’ said The Prophet, ‘We can’t ask the lady to choose randomly. Imagine that, “Pardon us miss, can randomly pick the next men to flirt with you? We can’t decide for ourselves.” And from the sounds of it, some of you wouldn’t be happy with a coin toss, or lottery. And it isn’t as if the two of you look any different now, is it?
‘Spit it out, man!’ yelled a man.
‘If each man feels so strongly about his right to take his turn, by all means, he should damn well take it!
        The men instantly exploded into a round of booming cheers. Their frustruations had reached the boiling point and they celebrated the simple suggestion that if you really felt entitled and if you really felt that the other man was not, well dammit, you were not going to just let him take advantage of you. If he felt so entitled to something, and if he felt so justified to have it, well then, he would fight for it, right? If you were willing to fight for something that someone else was not, then who values it more and who does not deserve it? Given no other way out, no equittable solution, each man is responsible for his own success and to fight for it if need be.
The crowd settles, and a man says to The Prophet, ‘How did you figure this out? I mean, I don’t think any of us has ever been forced into agreeing that competition and even fightin’ was justified. But here you are, making a case for it that none of us can argue with by posing questions that none of us can answer without arguin’ over. How’d you do it?’

‘Well,’ said the Prophet, ‘I realized that the world is full of situations like the problem we just argued over and that the only solution to them is outright overt competition. I also realized the existence of these problems is proof that we are all fated towards some injustice or another. Equittability is only equittable in a vaccuum gentlemen. We might as well make our own way with our own hands, using our own minds. Make no mistake about it, gentlemen, better and lesser men do exist. A neutral society does not deny that, it just chooses to ignore it. Well, if I am a better man, then so be it! And if it takes better men to save lesser men, then so be it! But do not, gentlemen, do not make that mistake of pretending that this society does not live and breathe at the whim of better men!’
