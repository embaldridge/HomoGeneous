# A Workers' Movement

The man turned Prophet woke and saw his world through a new lens. 
"No lotteries today. If I want something, I’ll take it. If I want a house, I’ll claim it." he said to himself, as he inspected himself for discrepancies.
        
Determined to turn a long due profit, The Prophet set out early to shake loose change from the pockets of a greedy willy-nilly Universe. He made the bed, took out the garbage, cleaned the dishes, swept the floors, scrubbed the tub and toilet, folded the loose end of the toilet paper into a neat point, and placed a mint on the bed pillow for the next inhabitant. Despite deciding to ignore the lotteries, he did not intend to endorse chaos.

The Prophet rode a bike towards the river wharf and mill district. The gristmill, sawmill, and brewery were, as was common knowledge, predominated by men. It was no secret that the work took a certain physical strength. Females rarely entered lotteries for mill work. This created a bias in Bath as far as which sex one might expect to find performing which jobs. The Prophet new how he could use this bias to raise an army among the log drivers and sawmill workers, pit wheel operators, brewers, and slipper men. The millworkers should be taking lunch right about now.
        
The wharf and mill district was quartered by the intersection of Ash Street and Bulker, and further split by brickwall alley-ways. It lay south of the business district and markets, and lay on the north bank of the Cohocton River, across which logs were rolled down from Mossy Bank. Bath, being a small town of mere few thousand was far from being an industrial hub and far from being a noisy, grinding, mechanical nightmare of rusting trains and train tracks. Lumber, grain, and brew were pulled into town on drays by shires horses, and they only had to pull for a mere mile or so to get them there. The mill district was not the sooty, scrap littered metal yards that one might see in the industrial parks of a modern *Homo sapiens* city, but was at worst, a cluster of old brick buildings and muddy cobble streets.

The main point of reference to the mill district was the eight sails of two windmills that drove the gristmill and sawmill. The sails, nearly twenty metres or more in length, were attached to the windshaft of six story tower mills. Each mill was made of brick and stone and was skirted on the fourth level by a deck that allowed access to the cap and its machinery. Each of the two mills faced the shallow river. The three story mill buildings extended nearly to Ash Street, across from which, were the lumber yards and silos.

The brewery stood west of Bulker and a stone's throw from the mills. The brewery was the third highest structure in Bath. From the top floor of the six floor building a rat could eat it's fill of grain in the brewery attic, descend the planks and ropes of the brick walls, squeak past the rough cut rafters and floor boards of fifth and fourth floors where the grain gets mashed, and, if it made it past the steaming vats of the third and second floors without being killed, it could sip from spilt remains of newly boiled brew that's ready to be racked and fermented.

The Prophet rode down Ash, turned onto Debaucher, and came to a building the size of a one-room schoolhouse. Inside, the millworkers and brewers were enjoying their lunch and the smell of freshly planed wood. The Prophet leaned his bike against its side and entered the building. He walked past the tables of men and up onto a small raised stage that was normally used for town hall meetings. A few men noticed, but most kept eating.

The Prophet spoke, "Three men walk into a pub and spy the last two women left alive at the end of the bar. Given the number of men and women, and the need to perpetuate our species, the men decide to draw straws to see who will get the first opportunity to address the women. While two will get first dibs, one must wait for one of the other two to fail to impress. What does the poor unlucky guy do?" Thirty men now looked up from their lunches. Most looked less than impressed.

"Well, does one of you have an answer?” asked The Prophet.
"He should wait his damn turn!" came a shout.
"Fair’s fair." said another, "He’ll get another chance before long, since one of the other two is bound to embarrass himself."
The men let out round of laughter.

"Well, let’s suppose one does fail and opens the door to the other," said The Prophet. "Does the man that just failed get to draw against the man-out or does the man out simply get to try his luck with the un-impressed lady?"

"He get’s his due chance!" said one man. "The man out shouldn’t need to draw against a man that just had his fair chance and blew it." said another.

"So you all suggest that the men just rotate until one of them pushes the right buttons?"

"That's right." said the men in near unison.

"Well let me ask you this," said The Prophet, "Say this goes on for ten more rounds, with one man failing and getting replaced by another. Let’s say the man with lady number two never fails but simply holds her attention. Meanwhile, lady number one is forced to put up with the same two men vying in-turn for her attention because she doesn't want to leave her friend's company. This means that if the two friends working on lady number one have had equal amounts of time, the friend with lady number two has had twice as much time as either of his two friends, averaged together. 

Now, let’s say that in the eleventh round, lady two gets bored with the man who was, up until now, able to hold her attention. At this point there are two ladies, one man who is talking with woman number one, one man who previously struck-out with woman number one and is now wooing woman number two, and one man who just struck-out with woman number two and is waiting to talk to woman number one."

"Now," continued The Prophet, "Let's say that the man talking to woman number two win's her approval. They leave the tavern and there is now one woman left, that is, woman number one. One man has spent twice as long as the other in wooing but has not yet talked with woman number one. The other man has had repeated chances to woo woman number one, but again, has only had half the time as the man, to do so. Is it still fair to take turns?"

"Well, one of them has had twice as much time as the other, the man with less time should go until they've got equal time. That’s why we started the whole rotation to begin with," one man shouted. Some of the men sent up their support.

"Wait a minute now," said another man, "The man talking to woman number one has had his chances and failed. The man with less opportunities should go. I thought we agreed on the rotation idea to make sure that each man gets a fair amount of turns. The man with more time has only had one turn.’ Again, some of the men, different one’s now, sent up their support.

"Who cares if he's only had one turn, he’s been in the entire damn time!" said another man.
"Sure, but it was still only one turn and wasn't with woman number one." shouted another.

"They should flip a coin for it!" said one man. "A fair coin flip makes for a fair flip!"
"No!" shouted another. "A fair flip makes for a fair flip."

"Stop the insanity!" cried another, "She's just a woman!"
"That isn’t the point!" yelled another.

The crowd grew louder and the disagreements grew more diverse. What started as two men with two differing opinions, grew into two groups with two differing opinions, which grew into four groups with four opinions. 

"Before long, each man will be arguing with every other! This is too easy!" The Prophet thought to himself. He took a staff from the corner and loudly stamped it onto the floor, breaking the arguments and getting the men’s attention.

"Well," asked the Prophet, "Is there a consensus?"
"There's no fair solution," said a man. "At least, not one free of the opinion of what fair might be."

"Well, you do agree that the situation could actually happen?" asked The Prophet. "And at being unable to find a fair solution, I imagine that each of you, if you were one of the two unfortunate men, would simply tip your hat to the last lady on Earth and forfeit?" Some men were silent but most either chuckled or threw up their hands in protest of the nonsense the Prophet brought to their otherwise peaceful lunch break.

"So, presuming there’s no backing out, what do you do?", asked The Prophet. He scanned his audience and waited for the answer. He didn't start the rouse without a reason and he didn't ask the question without having an answer ready. The Prophet enjoyed the pause. He had boldly stepped out of anonymity and into the front of their minds. He had driven his heel into their psyche and all he had to do was sew up the wound and apply his own topical. "Might I suggest a solution?" the Prophet asked.

"Well," said The Prophet, "If each of you were one of those men, and still felt so strongly about your right to take your fair time or fair turn, then by all means, you should damn well take it!"

"You're telling us that we should fight over it?" asked one man. "You're basically here to incite violence. That's all you're doing. You're telling us to ignore any attempt to make a situation fair."

"No, sir. I'm not", replied The Prophet. "I'm here to tell you that there is no fair situation. There is only ever an agreement to assume that all previous opportunities have created, in aggregate, equal success. In that way, we can pretend that with each situation comes a brand new and unbiased opportunity."


The men instantly exploded into a round of booming cheers. Their frustruations had reached the boiling point and they celebrated the simple suggestion that if you really felt entitled and if you really felt that the other man was not, well dammit, you were not going to just let him take advantage of you. If he felt so entitled to something, and if he felt so justified to have it, well then, he would fight for it, right? If you were willing to fight for something that someone else was not, then who values it more and who does not deserve it? Given no other way out, no equittable solution, each man is responsible for his own success and to fight for it if need be.
The crowd settles, and a man says to The Prophet, ‘How did you figure this out? I mean, I don’t think any of us has ever been forced into agreeing that competition and even fightin’ was justified. But here you are, making a case for it that none of us can argue with by posing questions that none of us can answer without arguin’ over. How’d you do it?’

‘Well,’ said the Prophet, ‘I realized that the world is full of situations like the problem we just argued over and that the only solution to them is outright overt competition. I also realized the existence of these problems is proof that we are all fated towards some injustice or another. Equittability is only equittable in a vaccuum gentlemen. We might as well make our own way with our own hands, using our own minds. Make no mistake about it, gentlemen, better and lesser men do exist. A neutral society does not deny that, it just chooses to ignore it. Well, if I am a better man, then so be it! And if it takes better men to save lesser men, then so be it! But do not, gentlemen, do not make that mistake of pretending that this society does not live and breathe at the whim of better men!’
