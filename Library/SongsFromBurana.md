#Songs from Burana

##O Fortuna
O Fortuna*,                O Fortune,
velut luna                like the moon
statu variabilis,                you are changeable,
semper crescis                ever waxing
aut decrescis;                and waning;
vita detestabilis                hateful life
nunc obdurat                first oppresses
et tunc curat                and then soothes
ludo mentis aciem,                as fancy takes it;
egestatem,                poverty
potestatem                and power
dissolvit ut glaciem.                it melts them like ice.
Sors immanis                Fate - monstrous
et inanis,                and empty,
rota tu volubilis,                you whirling wheel,
status malus,                you are malevolent,
vana salus                well-being is in vain
semper dissolubilis,                and always fades to nothing,
obumbrata                        shadowed
et velata                        and veiled
michi quoque niteris;                you plague me too;
nunc per ludum                now through the game
dorsum nudum                I bring my bare back
fero tui sceleris.                to your villainy.
Sors salutis                Fate is against me
et virtutis                in health
michi nunc contraria,                and virtue,
est affectus                driven on
et defectus                        and weighted down,
semper in angaria.                always enslaved.
Hac in hora                So at this hour
sine mora                without delay
corde pulsum tangite;                pluck the vibrating strings;
quod per sortem                since Fate
sternit fortem,                strikes down the strong man,
mecum omnes plangite!                everyone weep with me!




##The Prophet, looked at Hungry and spoke:  

Circa mea pectora*        In my heart
multa sunt suspiria                there are many sighs
de tua pulchritudine,                for your beauty,
que me ledunt misere.                        which wound me sorely. Ah!
Manda liet,                Mandaliet,
Manda liet                mandaliet,
min geselle                my lover
chumet niet.                        does not come.
Tui lucent oculi                        Your eyes shine
sicut solis radii,                                like the rays of the sun,
sicut splendor fulguris                                like the flashing of lightening
lucem donat tenebris.                                which brightens the darkness. Ah!
Manda liet                Mandaliet,
Manda liet,                mandaliet,
min geselle        my lover
chumet niet.                does not come.
Vellet deus, vallent dii                May the Universe grant,
quod mente proposui:                what I have in mind:
ut eius virginea                that I may loose
reserassem vincula.     the chains of her virginity. Ah!
Manda liet,                Mandaliet,
Manda liet,                mandaliet,
min geselle                my lover
chumet niet.                        does not come.

*O Fortuna is played twice in Carl Orffâ€™s Carmina Burana. As the first and last carmen, it begins the cantata explosively and powerfully and as omen of things to come; it ends the cantata with a climax on a profound note to humanity.
