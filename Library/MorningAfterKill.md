#3. The Morning-After Kill

Think back to waking up. Do not think about how the appearance of the room you woke in. Forget whether the first hue of light was blue or yellow, or how fuzzy those initial images might have been. Ignore whatever sounds or smells you first experienced when waking. Did you seamlessly emerge from a lucid dream into semi-wakefulness? Or, can you only say that at one point you were thinking when at some point immediately before it you were not. Prior to waking, you could not account for your own mind and you could not be asked to. Still, you were alive and breathing, and your brain was still operating without your knowledge.

Once you wake, what can you possible recall of waking other than having woken? In some minute fraction of a second, you weren't thinking and then you were. For all we all know we can only confirm that we are thinking when we're actually thinking about it. The change from unconsciousness to awareness is immediate and, in a way, timeless. We are not accounting for our minds and then we are. Likewise, we feel like shit because we're barely awake and laying in a bloody mess.

In the morning, after helping his sister finish off what was left of their parents, a man stood in the bathroom and examined himself in the mirror above the sink. Holding his hands in front of his face with outstretched fingers, he inspected the front and back and nails of each. His sister entered in a white robe.

"Can you tell me if there is anything special about me?" he asked.

"Sure," she answered. "turn around." She inspected him from head to toe. Her eyes ran from head to toe, looking for any detail that might cause him to be recognized. She paused and said, "Well, Your collar is turned up in the back. That's sure to get you noticed." She brought her hands close to his neck and turned down his collar. It was a close call.

"Is that it? Besides that, nothing is out of place?" he asked. She gave him one last look "You look exactly like the instructions say you should."

He let go of an anxious breath as she asked, "So, where are you headed off to?"

He answered looking at her through the mirror, "I think I'll stop by the school. You?"

"I was thinking the same thing, but it seems that we should split-up as soon as we can. The instructions say that we should get to different areas of town as soon as we leave the apartment." she said as she handed him a cup of coffee. 

After tidying up the apartment and giving each other one last inspection, the twin brother and sister prepared to leave the apartment where their parents had gone to die.

"After you." said the man, his fingers grasping the brass door knob that led outside. The seal of the door cracked and sucked in the first notes of mid-Spring lilac. The sun broke inside to reveal and recolor the eggshell hallway with rays of early morning amber and lemon yellow. The woman leaned forward, gathering the momentum to push off from one high-heeled shoe onto the other. She overcame her inertia and engaged the coolness of the dewy morning. Her brother's eyes gathered the light in heaps and in their haste, were dazzled and unable to hold their wide aperture. His pupils shrank to pin-points as the Spring air led him by his nose, flaring his nostrils and pulling him into the outside. 

"Ah, Spring!" she said, excitedly. "Here we go!"

"This is it," he replied, "the first day of the rest of our anonymous lives." Their eyes met in what they knew would be the last time they would ever recognize each other. "I think school is that way." She said, as she pointed off to left and beyond a patch of trees. They were standing on the stoop of a large Brownstone that overlooked a park, on the other side of which was the building she recognized from the map as Bath's school building.

"If I'm headed left, I suppose you're going right." he said, nearly asking. "Right," she said, "I think I'll stroll until something strikes me. There's a lot to explore and we'll have to learn a lot, and quickly."

The two said their good-bye's and departed, he towards the school and her towards the center of town and a quick but natural death.

It was warm and sunny. "The first this year," he thought. He passed the corner of Steuben and Gansevoort, and crossed through the field where, on as many days as the men who discovered it could manage, would lean against the old oak and stare out over the valley. The oak, being an early riser had woke with the blackbird's reveille. After taking a few sips of coffee, the man climbed the hill that bordered the park, made his way down Rumsey, and on having arrived at the school, drew a ticket from the genie machine.

He entered lotteries for three of Bath's most popular classes, Ethics of Identity, Pursuits of Liberty, and Practical Probability. The genie's gears turned and engaged the claw that drew a ticket that read "Room 3: Ethics of Identity".

As he entered the school building and made his way to his first class, he saw a man staring at the doorway that led inside the room where Ethics of Identity was being taught. The man looked as if he was gathering the resolve to enter.

"Excuse me, sir. Are you going in?" he asked the worried man.

"Looking like this? No." The worried man looked up at the man who had just walked up to him. "I need to collect myself. I'll only be a second. Feel free to go in."

The two men exchanged glances as the more eager of the two entered. The man who remained outside tried to collect himself in the last remaining moments before class began. Thoughts of the strange woman creeped into his mind. He thought how she could be watching him, hidden among the crowd of students. As he approached the classroom door, he felt as if he were being watched. This was a completely foreign sensation that made him feel exposed. We he entered, he would refuse to look up and search for the pair of eyes he felt were aimed at him. Still, he couldn't enter the classroom and instead, examined the hallway.

The lemon yellow sunshine of early morning spread like a film over the green ceramic tiles and their yellowed grout. Layers of chipped yellow-white shades of paint covering heavy metal frames and fixtures of the windows revealed a long history of dissatisfaction. If each layer of paint were peeled back to reveal the corpses of unlucky insects, would we accumulate all the insect species of Bath or just those prone to falling into fresh paint?

The school hallways were built to take a beating, to take the stamping of feet up and down stairs, to weather slams of lockers and classroom doors, to become littered and dirty during each day and scrubbed and disinfected each night. They were built to resist the pull of a hundred hands on railings and a thousand feet carrying more than one hundred thousand pounds of shrimp every forty-five minutes. The window panes were large and thick. Some were scalloped to diffuse and refract the light over the ceramic tiles and wooden doorways. The hallway had these scalloped windows at both ends and must have seemed to any passing giant that gazed inwards, to be a kaleidoscope. Finally, the hesitant man opened the door and stepped from the pale green tile, over the threshold, and into the classroom.
