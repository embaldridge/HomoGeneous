#3. The Morning-After Kill

Imagine waking up. Forget how the room might look and what you might look like within it. Reject the notion that you emerged from a realistic lucid dream into a day-dream semi-wakefulness. Don't focus on the tiredness and how pulling your head from the pillow might seem like pulling a slug from a glue trap. But then, What's left? After you remove the imagined set-like scene where an actor looking identical to yourself but much more groggy and for whom you can deeply empathize because, well, you literally know the actor feels, after that's gone, what are you left with besides the fact that, at in a fraction of a second, you weren't thinking and then you were. In fact, it's less than a fraction of a second. For all you know, because you can only confirm that you're thinking when you're actually thinking, the change is immediate. You cannot account for your mind, and then immediately, you feel like shit because you're awake and laying in a bloody mess.

The next morning, the man stood in the bathroom and examined himself in the mirror above the sink. Holding his hands in front of his face with outstretched fingers, he inspected the front, back, digits, and nails of each. He could find no trace of a distinguishing scrape, cut, cuticle, pen-mark, callous, hang-nail, or mole. His hands were well taken care of. His fingernails were cut to length, he had no hang-nails, and his cuticles were clean. He thought to himself, "She could have only seen my hands, face, hair, neck, clothes, and shoes. I didn't wear the same clothes or shoes on both days, so it must be something else." He called to the woman in the bedroom, ‘Can you come here?’

The woman from the night before entered in a white robe. "I want you to look and tell me if there is anything different about me, if there is anything that might distinguish me." 

"Let me see, no, no, turn around, no, no, oh wait."
"What is it?" he asked.

"Your collar is turned up in the back." She brought her hands close to his neck and turned down his collar. "Close call", she said.

"Is that it? Besides that, nothing is out of order?" She gave him one last look "You look completely undistinguished. Feel better?"

"Yes, thanks." He let go of a stifled breath as she asked, "So, where are you headed off to?"

"I am going back to school."

His fingers grasped the brass door knob leading to outside freedom, and turned. The heavy door opened and sucked in the first notes of lilac. As the door opened to the outside world, the sun shoved its heavy foot inside and pushed against the door to reveal its withholdings and the dank guts of Brownstone’s insides. The man leaned forward, gathering the momentum to push off from one foot and onto the other, over-coming his inertia and engaging the cool sweetness of the illuminated outside. His eyes gathered the light in heaps and in their haste became dazzled and unable to hold it all. His pupils shrank to pin-points as the Spring air led him by his nose, flaring his nostrils and pulling him into the outside. "Ah, Spring!"

It was warm and sunny. "The first this year," he thought. He passed the corner of Steuben and Ganesvoort, and crossed through the field where, on as many days as he could manage, he would lean against the old oak and stare out over the valley. The oak, being an early riser had responded to the Red-winged blackbird's reveille. After taking a few sips of coffee, the man climbed the hill that bordered the causeway, made his way down Rumsey, past McMaster and Washington, and on having arrived back at the school, where he knew his stalker would be waiting.

He entered lotteries for three of Bath's most popular classes, Ethics of Identity, Pursuits of Liberty, and Practical Probability. The gears turns and engaged the claw that drew his ticket. "Ethics of Identity, it is", he said aloud.

As he entered the school building and made his way to his first class, thoughts of the strange woman creeped into his mind. He thought how she could be watching him, hidden among the crowd of students. As he approached the classroom door, he felt as if he were being watched. This was a completely foreign sensation that made him feel exposed. He refused to look up and search for the pair of eyes he felt were aimed at him. He stood, momentarily outside the classroom. 

The green ceramic tiles of the wall and their yellowed grout, the colored strata of the chipped paint covering the heavy metal frames and fixtures of the windows and stair railing revealed that they had been painted mainy times before. What small insects were caught in each freshly laid coat of paint? If we were to peel back each layer and reveal the corpses, would we accumulate all the insect species of Bath or just those prone to falling into fresh paint? If this school stood for a thousand years and our descendents were to peal back the layers of paint, would they uncover even more species of spider and fly and bee and bug? Perhaps, they would find species that had no business at this latitude or in this clime, but had lost a few of its kind to the traveling entomologist or had hitched rides on the backs of migrating geese or rogue winds. If this school stood for ten million years and our descendents, whether of our species or of some other, were to do the same, would they uncover species of spider and fly and bee and bug which had not existed ten million years prior, or would they find new forms altogether?

School hallways were built to take a beating, to take the anxious stamping of feet up and down stairs, to weather the slams of lockers and classroom doors, to become littered and dirty during each day and thoroughly scrubbed and disinfected each night, to resist the pull of a hundred hands on railings, and a thousand feet carrying the swarm of more than one hundred thousand pounds every forty-five minutes. The window panes were large and thick. Some were transparent and allowed a limited view of the town and schoolyard and some were scalloped to diffuse and refract the light. The hallway had these scalloped windows at both ends and must have seemed to any passing giant that gazed inwards, to be a boring kind of kaleidoscope with its uniform and identical grey crystals moving about inside. He opened the door and stepped from the pale green acrylic tile over the threshold and into the classroom.




        The next morning, the man turned prophet, The Prophet, woke and saw his world through a new lense. Determined to turn his due profit, The Prophet set-out early to shake the loose change from the pockets of the Universe. Well, actually, given the lack of currency in Homo neutralis society, that is technicially incorrect. Still though, the metaphor has done its job. Regardless, you cannot really see a man shaking anything from the pockets of the Universe, now can you? The Universe hasn’t got any pockets, now has it? You see where your absurb fetish with literal interpretation leads, now can’t you? Moving on with our story.
        After making his bed, taking out the garbage, cleaning the dishes, sweeping and mopping the floors, dusting, scrubbing the tub and toilet bowl, cleaning the lint filter, folding the toilet paper, and placing a mint on the pillow for the next inhabitant, The Prophet left the house he had stayed at the night before, caution and care to the wind. ‘If I want a bicycle, I’ll just take one. If I want a house, I’ll just find one. If I want a seat beside the fire-place…well, I can’t just sit there. Surely somebody’s bound to object. I’ll have to keep to the simple things for now,’ he said to himself as he walked along. And indeed, he had just walked into an empty house and squatted at it for the night...he did tidy-up before he left, though. And, when he came to a rack of bicycles, he just took the one he wanted…with every intention of returning it, of course.
        One should not be so naïve as to make the mistake of mistaking The Prophet as a man of misanthropy who has completely abandoned all consideration and care for his fellow man. Indeed, it was only women that he had any real complaints about. With their tiny frames and short limbs, how was it that he was made to compete on the same level with these physically inept things. How many times had he lost a seat in a café, a place in the theatre, or a home for the night…a cozy artisan cottage, to one of the flippant things.

‘Look out!’ screamed a woman.
‘Ruf!’ screamed her dog.
‘Yikes!’ screamed The Prophet, as he veeried sharply into a deep puddle.
‘You nearly ran me over,’ she shouted, ‘You nearly killed my dear poopsie-sicle!’
In his tirade against the other sex had nearly impaled a woman and her small sweatered dog at high speed as they crossed May Street onto Eleventh Avenue. ‘I’m sorry ma’am, really, I wasn’t paying attention. I’m so sorry. Are you okay?’ he asked.
‘Hmph,’ said the woman.
She turned to her poopsie-sicle as said, ‘Are you okay my little poopsie-woopsie? The bad man didn’t hurt you, did he? He should watch where he’s going shouldn’t he?’
The dog, apparently having learned that it pays for him to whine when his master whined, whined. The woman gathered herself, jerked her dog-child to attention, and walked off.        
        The Prophet, standing in ankle deep street water, having careened his bicycle into a curb, stared at the back of the woman’s head and tried his best to burn a hole through it. He thought to himself, ‘I’ll get you my pretty, and your little dog too!’*
Dogs and other pets, you might think, would be an impossibility in this society. After all, what is the sense in trying to look indistinguishing when you have got a yappy inbred and highly reduced wolf walking and jerking alongside you? I would inform you then, that you have once more taken an unwitting jump through a flaming hoop of misconclusion. Just as one might enter a lottery to check out a bike, or a drawing to check out a library book, one could just as easily enter a raffle to win a Bichon Frise for the day, or some other agreed upon length of time. 


*A shameless nod to the Wizard of Oz.


The Prophet rode his bike, with his sopping wet left foot, towards the river wharf and mill district. There, he would find the Bath mills, and in them, he would find his first converts. The gristmill, sawmill, and brewery were, as was common knowledge, predominated by men. It was no secret that the work took a certain physical strength and tolerance for malodor, which was most often indistinguishable from the male odor of the indistinguishable males working there. More often than not, less females chose mill work as one of their preferred occupations, than did males. More often still, many men chose mill work more often than not. This created some bias in Bath as far as which sex one might expect to find performing which jobs. This bias was not, of course, an afront to neutrality or the lotteries. It would be rather absurd to force equal proportions of men and women in each profession, especially if they preferred it to be disproportionate. This meant that at the mills, a mysoginist looking to raise an army, and many of the army raising type seem to be bent in that direction, could find his recruits among the log drivers and sawmill workers, pit wheel operators and slipper men, brewers and brewmasters. In fact, the millworkers should be taking lunch right about now.
        
The wharf and mill district was cut in half, north to south, by Ash Street and east to west by the streets of Baulker, Belcher, and DeBaucher. All in all, the district consisted of four main blocks with many narrow brick-laned alley-ways. Geographically it lay south of the business district and markets, north of the port of Bath and east of the Bath River, down which the logs were sent from the northern pine forests. Bath, being a small town of mere few thousand was far from being an industrial hub and far from being a noisy, grinding, mechanical nightmare of rusting trains and train tracks. Lumber, grain, and brew were pulled into town on drays by shires horses, and they only had to pull for a mere mile or so to get them there. The mill district was not the sooty, scrap littered metal yards that one might see in the industrial parks of a modern Homo sapiens city, but was at worst, an ugly cluster of old brick buildings and muddy streets. 
Riding south into the mill district one’s eye was drawn west to the eight sails of the two windmills that drove the gristmill and sawmill. These were separated by DeBaucher Street. The sails measure forty feet or more in length and each is attached to the windshaft of a six story tower mill. Each tower mill, in turn, was made of brick and stone and was skirted on the fourth level by a deck that allowed access to the cap and its machinery. Each of the two mills faced the wide and shallow river. From the bankside of each, projected a narrow three story building, one for mill grain and one for processing lumber. Each three story mill building extended nearly to Ash Street. Across Ash, were the lumber yards, silos for storing grain, and warehouses where grain was bagged and spilt.

South of Bulker, the southmost east-to-west street in Bath, stood the Bath Brewery, the third towering structure in Bath’s tiny mill district. From the six floor of the main building a rat could eat it's fill of grain in the brewery attic, descend the planks and ropes of the brick walls, and squeak past the rough cut rafters and floor boards of fifth and fourth floors where the grain gets mashed, and finally, past the steaming vats on the third and second floors where the grain is boiled to the first floor where the solution is put into ferment and where the fermented beer is racked and some spilled.

The Prophet rode down Ash, past Bulker, turned right onto Debaucher and came to a schoolhouse sized building. Inside, the millworkers and brewers were enjoying their lunch and the smell of freshly planed wood. Having leaned his bike against its side, The Prophet entered the building, walked past the tables of men, and up onto a small raised stage. A few men noticed, but most kept eating and talking. 

The Prophet spoke "Three men walk into a pub and upon getting’ their drinks, spy the last two women on Earth at the end of the bar. Given the number of men to women, the men decide to draw straws. Two will get a chance to secure the last two females on Earth, and one must wait for one of the other two to fail. What does the poor unlucky guy do?" 

Thirty men now looked up from their lunches and, in giving each other shrugs of perplexity, looked to the back of break house. 

"Well, does one of you have an answer?” asked The Prophet.
"He should wait his damn turn!" came a shout.
"Fair’s fair!" shouted another, "He’ll get another chance before long!"
The men let out round of laughter.

‘Good, good,’ says The Prophet to himself, ‘I’ve got their interest.’
‘Well, let’s suppose one man fails, and opens the floor to the other. Does the man that just failed get to draw against the man-out or does the man out just get to try his luck with the unoccupied lady?’
‘Aye, he get’s his fair chance with the lady!’ shouted one man.
‘The man out shouldn’t need to draw against a man that just had his fair chance and blew it!’ said another.
‘So you all suggest that the men just rotate until one of them pushes the right buttons, seein’ the persistent cocks don’t scare off the hens?’
‘Aye,’ said the men in near unison.
‘Well let me ask you this,’ said The Prophet, ‘Say this goes on for ten more rounds, with one man failing and getting replaced by another. Let’s say the man with lady number two never fails but holds her attention while the other two take turns trying to make a favorable impression on lady number one. This means that if the two friends working on lady number one have had equal amounts of time, the friend with lady number two has had twice as much time as either of friends. Now, let’s say that in the eleventh round both friends strike-out. Now, there’s two available ladies. By your logic, the man who was just out should get a chance with lady he wasn’t with last time, right? Let’s say they hit it off, and leave the tavern. One lady left on planet Earth. By your logic, the friend that was with lady opposite the one now taken should have his chance, correct?’
The men agreed, but sensed that they were being led into a trap.
‘Then, I ask you this. One man has had twice as long as the other, but has not been with the lady in-waiting. The other friend was just with her, but has only had half the time as the other. Who goes? Do they flip for it?
‘Well, one of’em has had twice as much time as the other, the man with less time should go. That’s why we started the whole rotation to begin with,’ one man shouted.
Some of the men sent up their support.
‘Wait a minute now,’ said another man, ‘The other man has just had his chance with that lady and has had many chances with her, but failed. The man with more time that has not been with her should go. I thought we agreed on the rotation plan to make sure that each man gets a fair amount of turns, not time. The man with more time has only had one turn.’
Again, some of the men, different one’s now, sent up their support.
‘Who care how many turns he’s had, he’s been in the entire damn time!’ said another man.
‘They could flip a coin for it!’ said one man.
‘A fair coin flip makes for a fair coin flip and nothin’ more!’ replied another.
‘Stop the insanity!’ cried another, ‘She just a woman!’
‘That ain’t the point!’ yelled another, ‘Ye big baby!’
The crowd grew louder and the disagreements grew more heated. What started as two men with two differing opinions, grew into two groups with two differing opinions, and that grew into four groups with four opinions. ‘Before long, each man will be arguing with every other! This is too easy!’ The Prophet thought to himself. He took a staff from the corner and loudly stamped it onto the floor, breaking the arguments and getting the men’s attention.
‘Well,’ asked the Prophet, ‘What’s your answer?’
‘Aye, t’aint no solution to that problem, not without opinion.’ said a man.
‘Aye,’ said the rest of them.
‘Well, you do agree that the situation could actually happen?’ asked The Prophet.
‘Aye,’ said the men.
‘And do you think
‘And at being unable to find an equittable solution, I imagine that each of you, if you were one of the two unfortunate men, would simply tip your hat to the last lady on Earth and forfeit?’ The men were silent.
‘So, presuming there’s no backing out, what do you do?’
The Prophet, scanned his audience. He looked into each of their eyes, and each them looked into his, waiting for the answer. After all, who would start such a rouse without a reason for it? Who would ask such a question without having an answer in his bullpen? The Prophet enjoyed this attention, he had stepped straight out of obscurity, into the fronts of their minds, and drove his heel deep into their psyche. Now, all he had to do was sew it up.
‘Might I suggest a solution, gentlemen?’ the Prophet asked.
‘Aye,’ said the men.
‘Well,’ said The Prophet, ‘We can’t ask the lady to choose randomly. Imagine that, “Pardon us miss, can randomly pick the next men to flirt with you? We can’t decide for ourselves.” And from the sounds of it, some of you wouldn’t be happy with a coin toss, or lottery. And it isn’t as if the two of you look any different now, is it?
‘Spit it out, man!’ yelled a man.
‘If each man feels so strongly about his right to take his turn, by all means, he should damn well take it!
        The men instantly exploded into a round of booming cheers. Their frustruations had reached the boiling point and they celebrated the simple suggestion that if you really felt entitled and if you really felt that the other man was not, well dammit, you were not going to just let him take advantage of you. If he felt so entitled to something, and if he felt so justified to have it, well then, he would fight for it, right? If you were willing to fight for something that someone else was not, then who values it more and who does not deserve it? Given no other way out, no equittable solution, each man is responsible for his own success and to fight for it if need be.
The crowd settles, and a man says to The Prophet, ‘How did you figure this out? I mean, I don’t think any of us has ever been forced into agreeing that competition and even fightin’ was justified. But here you are, making a case for it that none of us can argue with by posing questions that none of us can answer without arguin’ over. How’d you do it?’

‘Well,’ said the Prophet, ‘I realized that the world is full of situations like the problem we just argued over and that the only solution to them is outright overt competition. I also realized the existence of these problems is proof that we are all fated towards some injustice or another. Equittability is only equittable in a vaccuum gentlemen. We might as well make our own way with our own hands, using our own minds. Make no mistake about it, gentlemen, better and lesser men do exist. A neutral society does not deny that, it just chooses to ignore it. Well, if I am a better man, then so be it! And if it takes better men to save lesser men, then so be it! But do not, gentlemen, do not make that mistake of pretending that this society does not live and breathe at the whim of better men!’
