**Q.** Why write a story in computing code?  
**A.** Uh huh. Next question.

**Q.** How much of this novel is already written?  
**A.** About 80,000 words and 20 chapters. I'm only beginning to translate it to working Python code.

**Q.** Is the source code supposed to be read or run?  
**A.** Both. It's a story written in Python that when ran, tells itself.

**Q.** Wouldn't this best be done in an iPython notebook?  
**A.** Yeah, probably.
