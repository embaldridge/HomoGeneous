# HomoNeutralis

## A dystopian novel written in working Python code that perverts identity, equality, property, and gender.

### equal opportunities != equal outcomes

For centuries, stories have been told on paper and bound in books that sometimes offered illustrations to aid a fictitious narrative. For a few less centuries, scientific discoveries have been communicated on paper and bound in journals, and often had equations, plots, and graphs to show that the discovery was not fictitious. Somehow, I couldn't bring myself to write science fiction using fictitious science. So, I am translating a novel that breathes human life into a scientific theory into working source code, and it will generate the sorts of results that I would normally use to show that I did not just make things up, but yet discovered some novel things.

**Q.** Why write a story in computing code?  
**A.** Because my prose is less intelligible. 

**Q.** How much of this novel is already written?  
**A.** About 80,000 words and 20 chapters. I'm only beginning to translate it to working Python code. 

**Q.** Am I supposed to read it or run it?  
**A.** The story is revealed by reading the source code. Running the source code aids the narrative by generating data, plots, and examples.

**Q.** Data, plots, and examples of what?  
**A.** That everything in this story is underpinned by principles of probability.
