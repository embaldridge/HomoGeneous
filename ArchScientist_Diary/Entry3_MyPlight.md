# My Plight

My discovery of the sexually homogeneous species of human, *Homo geneous*, marked a turning point in our knowledge of human evolution and likewise, in our place in the world as the only sentient and philosophical species. The global community of *Homo sapiens* had once stood ready to make first contact with its lost sister species. Everyone simply assumed that I would reveal where I had made my discovery. Truth be told, it took me more than a year to replicate it.For weeks, I spoke to audiences of scientists, politicians, and military leaders. I presented my findings to the world's most esteemed universities. The world's most advanced research centers poured over the notes and photographs I had taken and the samples of soil, plants, tissues and hair I had gathered. The books I brought back, written by the *Homo geneous*, puzzled everyone.
Then, all slowly began to suspect that I had no intention of letting Schrodinger's cat out of its box. The public perception was that I was somehow attempting to thwart the immense military and scientific efforts being made to locate the village the *Homo geneous* called Bath. Eventually, public disdain came to a confluence of backlash and threats. Where I once spoke freely on my discovery, I now found myself defending my ignorance and attempting to prove a negative. I had no idea where from I had returned and I had no way to prove it.

I was interrogated and denounced. I was found guilty of tax evasion, abandonment, and fraud. I was fired, exhiled, and eventually imprisoned. But, through all of it, I still owned my decisions and, for better or worse, I owned my convictions. Still, having lost all positions and possessions including my liberty, my strife increased geometrically.

I write these notes from my small home and think of how prisoners and cloistered monks refer to their homes as cells. To one it is a prison but to the other, a retreat for quiet contemplation. I suppose it is the exercise of individual liberty that makes them differ most. A monk can take a walk, if he chooses.

As a prisoner, I cannot come and go as I please. As a monk, I am free to contemplate on what has been revealed to me and on what has been kept a mystery. I studied *Homo geneous* in isolation for nearly three years while also trying to find my way home. When I succeeded in returning home, I failed for a year to rediscover *Homo geneous*. As far as I know, I am the only member of our species to have witnessed a living *Homo geneous*, or to at least have known I have. As far I know, they have been found already.
