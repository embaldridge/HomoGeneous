#An Introduction to *Homo geneous*I, Dr. Quincy Coyle once spoke freely and frequently on my discovery of a new species of human, *Homo geneous*. I studied the species for nearly three years and since the time of my return to the civilizations of *Homo sapiens*, have been the only member of our species to have witnessed a living *Homo geneous*, or to at least have known I have.
The discovery of *Homo geneous* marked a turning point in our knowledge of human evolution and likewise, in our place in the world as the once only sentient and uniquely ethical species. At one time, the global community of *Homo sapiens* stood ready to make first contact. It was assumed I would reveal where my discovery had been made and to where I had dissappeared for nearly three years. The truth is, it took me no less than a year to find from where I had returned.

For weeks, I spoke to audiences of scientists, politicians, military leaders, and privileged journalists. Then, the world slowly realized that I would not let Schrodinger's cat out of the bag or box. In the attempts of governments and corporations to force my hand, I lost nearly everything I owned. At first, I declined their money. Then, I defied their threats. I even denied my closest colleagues to protect *Homo geneous* from us.

Most of my possessions and positions were taken from me. I was interrogated, dehumanized, and denounced. But, I still owned my decisions and for better or worse, I owned my convictions. In having most everything I owned and occupied stripped from me, my strife increased geometrically.
Here, I include notes from my early lectures and seminars. I have instructed my assistant and confidant to distribute them to you. As you read these notes, know that I, like every scientist never knows the entire truth, not even to our very own discoveries.

## SociobiologyI would like to begin with an account of the sociobiology of *Homo geneous*. Perhaps, the first thing to note about *Homo geneous*, is that all males look and act alike, as do all females. In my years of studying them, I only ever once witnessed an interaction indicating that any of them could recognize any of them. In fact, they seem to make every effort to remain completely anonymous. 
There is no family structure, no personal wealth, no permanent occupations, and no names. I had concluded that this was because all of these would establish distinct identities. As it was, if there were identities, the solely belonged as the private property of their owners. Still, every *Homo geneous* conforms to an average image and demeanor, around which, little or no variation exists among the entire population.Interactions among individual *Homo geneous* are very polite. I never witnessed a fight or aggressive display or moment of overt hostility within my three years of studying their village. I am rather sure they all understood or felt the hesitation of fighting equally matched opponents. Because all the evidence points to an event of speciation from the *Homo sapiens* line, the aggression that we experience on an everyday basis and the frequency with which we attempt to use that aggression to dominate others, must have been strongly selected against. 
Perhaps, after some ecological catastrophe had culled the genetic diversity from their ancestral population, individuals that chose to fight equally-matched competitors for food, shelter, and mates stood a much higher risk of incurring some wound or injury or lack of energy that would have been fatal in a more hostile and less predictable environment, perhaps, where predation and disease were more prevalent and where man was less technologically superior to defend against either.
That said, I have seen frustration and anger among the *Homo geneous*, I just have not seen an instance where it was used towards othres. In fact, the differences in aggression and violence between *Homo geneous* and *Homo sapiens* may be somewhat similar to the differences in aggression seen among Chimpanzees and Bonobos; very similar primates that exhibit strikingly different levels of hostility. 
Consider this, if you are a *Homo geneous* then you have one opportunity to reproduce and you can only do that by making your way in a world of identical competitors that are equally matched in every way with the only difference among the sexes being morphological. It is simply in the best interest of every *Homo geneous* to live peacefully and cooperate. I suppose I should explain why you would have only one chance to reproduce.

## Reproduction and developmental biologyThe young of *Homo geneous* are precocial and so, are capable of foraging and protecting themselves soon after birth. The male parent dies almost immediately after copulation and the female parent dies soon after birth. As a result of their semelparous reproduction, similar to that of salmon and many insects, *Homo geneous* do not experience the drawn-out senescence that is typical of *Homo sapiens* and other primates. Instead, the adults of *Homoe geneous* reproduce once and die very shortly afterwards. Unlike salmon but still like insects, the young are cannibalistic and, from what I can tell, they consume the parents within forty eight hours of birth and grow rapidly to adult size during that time.
In terms of courtship, this is what I have observed. A male and female enter a studio apartment of approximately fifteen hundred square feet. They copulate and the male immediately dies. The young develop rapidly inside the female and are born within twenty-four hours. This causes systemic damage the mothers organ systems, and should result in rapid depletion of nutrients and fat stores, extensive digestion of the muscle tissues, and severe dehydration, a result of which is the weakening of tissues around the birth canal allowing for ease of a passive delivery or active emergence. 

Death of the mother ensues immediately after the infants first feeding. Three days later, after having consumed the remains of the parents, twin siblings, one male and one female, emerge from the apartment, fully grown, well-dressed, and eager to enter into polite society.Clearly, the reproductive biology and the evolutionary traits that allow for it, make *Homo geneous* unique among all mammals. However, I would argue that the initial evolutionary departure of *Homo geneous*  from our own species most likely owes to a single ecological catastrophe. This event would have decimated the genetic diversity of a population of early *Homo sapiens*, perhaps one that was already predisposed to premature births of obese children.


## Speciation and evolution
In its evolutionary departure from *Homo sapiens*, *Homo geneous* evolved towards ever increasing similarity within the sexes. I say this because there has never been evidence of such an extreme lack of sexual dimorphism in the entire evolutionary history of the *Homo* genus. This meant that differences in size, strength, and intelligence that once granted exceptional individuals exceptional opportunities were, at some point, selected against. Instead, *Homo geneous* must have evolved under severe selection for sophisticated social bargaining.

In the case of *Homo geneous*, the advent of their speciation was, as much as I can discern, caused by a catastrophe that sent a small geographically isolated population of early modern human careening off the rails of hominid evolution and speciating towards the current state of homogenized sexual morphology. This population preference for an honest set of near perfectly heritable and honest traits likely created a positive feedback for increased similarity within the sexes; a vicious cycle of natural selection for decreasing deviations from the optimal combination of traits. 
Now, in both *Homo sapiens* and *Homo neutralis* societies, sexual selection favors individuals that represent the closest thing to an optimal solution that the population gene pool has to offer. But, among *Homo sapiens*, one set of traits not conferring sterility or a severe handicap is nearly as suitable as any other for throwing genes into the next generation. The distribution of optimality has many modes. Among *Homo geneous*, the optimal choice for a mate became aggregated at two suites of traits representing two population averages, one for males and one for females.Now, I would not pretend that a sexual species would persist in the hands of individuals incapable of recognizing who best, with which, to have sex. Notice that I did not say “which with, to bear and raise children”. For *Homo neutralis*, sex and death are bedfellows that bear precocious cannibals. Still, many sexual animal species reproduce without providing parental care, but I understand why one might see this as an odd or maladaptive strategy for any species of mammal. Mammals need milk and how is milk to be provided if the mother is absent? Large mammals require years to mature and days to years to walk. Mammalian infants require shelter and how is that to be provided by absentee parents? Humans are psychosocially complex creatures that spend nearly two decades learning how to navigate their competitive and often merciless societies. How is that to be accomplished without biological or adopted parents?I would also not pretend that a species of human would persist in the hands of deadbeat parents and I insist that one only needs to examine the facts to see that *Homo geneous* are anything but. I have already proposed that the young are precocial and rapidly grow to a functioning adult form in two days time. I have also proposed that females die shortly after birth. In fact, they survive long enough to provide an initial cleaning of the young and a nutritious meal. There is potentially more in the refrigerator along with clear directions for its preparation. I cannot pretend to deign how these severe departures from normal human and mammalian evolution evolved. Rest assured, the species would not have evolved not having solved the problems you are pondering. That they exist necessitates that they have.How is it possible that a species of human could be semelparous, that is, reproduce once and die soon after? Well, I do not know how a species of man could be more similar to a species of fish than to another species of man in its reproductive biology, except to say that humans are mammals and mammals evolved from something nearly reptilian that had evolved from something amphibian that had long since evolved from fish. Every now and again, someone back tracks and a child with webbed feet is born. 
Luckily, modern classification systems in evolutionary biology are not based behaviors and superficial physical traits, but are instead based on fossil and histological evidence and, of course, genetic similarities. Consequently, *Homo geneous* along with whales and dolphins, are mammals and are not fish.
It is also well known that interesting and uncommon reproductive strategies can be found in stable environments and that this makes good evolutionary sense. For example, if a species converges on some optimal set of traits then the mode of reproduction could change to conserve that set of traits. In reptiles, this has resulted in species composed entirely of females that fertilize their own eggs and produce young without ever copulating with a male. This form of individual cloning is still sexual reproduction, it simply happens with one’s self. 
Likewise, there are a lot of pressures for the young of vulnerable or highly competitive populations to develop quickly, but to grow to adulthood in three days or less, I don’t have anything other than speculations. And, in the case of cannibalism, that is easier to explain than their semelparity. Of course, ease of explanation does not imply correctness. The fact is, the parents reproduce and die. The young grow quickly and so need a quantity and composition of nutrition that is capable of providing the building blocks for more than a hundred pounds of human tissue in under three days. Likewise, the young need water and to be inoculated with the proper microorganismal culture. All of this, except for perhaps water consumption, can be provided for by the parents, post mortem. Of course, there is water available from the tap. Consequently, it is economy.

# Sexual selectionAs you know, evolutionary change through sexual reproduction is brought about by individuals that outcompete their peers in a subconscious race to reproduce that is fueled by the very conscious race of having sex with someone with whom others want to have sex. Now, in societies of *Homo sapiens*, ‘desirable’ means exceptionally attractive, exceptionally convenient, or exceptionally similar in attractiveness to oneself. In stark contrast, within H. neutralis society, ‘desirable’ appears to mean exceptionally close to the population average, that is, how most people of the opposite sex look and act most of the time. Exceptionally average is exceptionally desirable in *Homo geneous*  society. You can think about it this way:
Envision that nearly all human traits have near perfect heritability. Beautiful athletic couples always bear beautiful athletic children, smart creative couples always bear smart creative children, and reliable rational people would always bear reliable rational children right on time and without excessive screaming. Likewise, over aggressive people with a host of physical asymmetries and maladaptive stress responses would almost always bear children that blame their parents for everything. 
If all this were true, and if some combination of traits led to better chances of living long enough to have sex, then a population would hone in on a super sexy set of traits. Indeed, any trait that is evolutionarily important must, to some degree, be heritable. Likewise, heritable traits have to confer some degree of honesty. Looking strong and healthy should usually mean being strong and healthy. Otherwise, sexual selection would be nothing more than a random pull from a grab bag of liars. Now, envision what might happen if the evolution of a sentient social species had the knobs on genetic heritability and phenotypic honesty cranked off their threads.
Over many generations of runaway selection, near perfectly heritable traits could become linked such that individuals nearly always have all the preferable traits or none of them at all. *Homo sapiens* has forced this situation on scores of plants and animals, so don’t let this pose an intellectual challenge to you. Of course, the traits of most any species are typically far from perfectly heritable or perfectly honest. However, *Homo geneous* is not just any species. To be sure, if any modern species of human were to impose a regime of selection on themselves for the honest expression and near perfect heritability of traits, one might wonder what crimes against humanity were committed.

# Ecology and CompetitionAmong *Homo sapiens*, competition is undertaken by attempting to overcome aggressive competitors. What ensues is often hostile and conducted because the hostility itself is entertaining to those who dare not or cannot compete but who do not mind managing, that is, conducting. Among the common ingredients of aggressive competition is a belief in superiority; that the Universe is on one side or the other. That there is a chosen one or even a chosen people. Among the *Homo geneous*, this is Lunacy. I will describe the proto-religion that came to be called Lunacy, in future entries.Students of ecology are taught that the effects of overt competition on competitors is nearly always negative. Competition, if you do not know, is one of the most important ecological mechanisms by which individuals, populations, and species flourish, fail, crush, and coexist. But whether in ecology and biology, business or boxing, competing takes away from all takers. The effort alone takes time, money, blood, sweat, tears; in short, things most of us do not want wasted. Though only one may win, all will suffer for having tested their mettle. Of course, we might say that one can increase one's chance of winning by trying harder, but that requires risking more. In the long run, going for broke usually just means getting broken.
I surmise that *Homo geneous* saw an alternative to such ham-fisted ways of getting one's way. This was, in part, potentially made possible by virtue of being homogeneous within the sexes and, in part, by virtue of being in possession of minds much more appreciative of probability than that of your typical wise man, that is, *Homo sapiens*. The entire species or population of *Homo geneous* had quickly realized quite early in their evolutionary departure from some common ancestor that one could increase one's profits by balancing cost and risk. In fact, this species-wide decision was made before any of them realized the potential for transacting the worth of real world goods and services for symbolic tokens, such as coins.
I would guess that *Homo geneous* realized that the game of life can be long and that most successful people plan to live a long lives. As it is, I think they realized that the most successful life strategies are not the exciting ‘go for broke’ sort we like to see from others but rarely attempt ourselves. No. Most of the most successful life strategies are pretty boring. For example, what one should really want in the long term is to maximize the average payoff in a compromise to minimize cost. But boy, is that boring!

# Concluding remarksThink of *Homo geneous* as the long-lost sister of *Homo sapiens* that went careening off the *Homo* trajectory since their speciation from *Homo habilis*. Perhaps, *Homo geneous* was a population of *Homo sapiens* that suffered some genetic bottleneck. That is, some disastrous plague or war that crushed the population and leveled it to a barely sustainable fraction of what it once was. 

I think of *Homo geneous* as the love-child of Henry David Thoreau and Emma Goldman or as the offspring of an anarchic artisan population that inhabited some unknown province in what seemed to be some place near New England. Now, by anarchic, I do not mean the sort of helter-skelter most might imagine. I mean anarchic as in what is exactly meant in the roots of the word, i.e., without rule and without rulers. I think of this love-child of nature and free-will as conceived to a scientific rendition of Carmina Burana, a collection of hedonistic poems written several centuries ago by the drunken student monks of Paris and set to symphonic bliss several decades ago by the talented Carl Orff. Carmina Burana extols the beauty of nature, a longing for sensuality, and the wayward personalities of those chance conjoined twins, those opposite sides of the same coin, Mister Fate and Miss Fortune.
Whatever is responsible for the contemporary state of *Homo geneous*, I assure you it was reached by many rounds of selection and genetic drift acting on the variation generated by random mutations and the fit of the resulting combinations of traits to the environments in which individuals sought to survive by adopting whatever strategies they could wield. You should know, I was once a scientist. I am no longer and you will no doubt learn why, as you learn more.
