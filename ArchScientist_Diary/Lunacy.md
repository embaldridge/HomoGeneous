# Lunacy

Lunacy is a proto-religion, more of a superstition really, but reduces to a belief that the behavior of lunar objects, celestial bodies, and the agenda of an intelligent and all powerful universe, govern the lives of all people. The meaning of celestial behaviors and moods of the Universe are interpreted by The Prophet, who if he knew how to spell the word he had in mind, would call himself The Profit. In short, the most basic tenet in the beliefs of Lunatics is that the Universe hates most people and likes but a few. Lunatics have a very poor understanding of probability.
