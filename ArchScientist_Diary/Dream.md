# A memorable dream

**27 Jan:** Last night I had a dream. 
A fucking nightmare is what is was.
From unconscious blackness, I came-to in the center seat of a Piercing Pagoda.
I was having a cheap half-gold half-whatever-would-likely-turn-my-skin-green necklace made to fit. 
It had block letters in white and yellow low-grade gold that read, "24-7-Science-24-7" along with a few characters I can't recall but that probably got me double charged for shoddy work.

If the dream meant anything, it was this: From the base of my brain where all the anxiety is kept, the pressure cooked insecurities of a half-cocked confidence bubbled up and into the bit of brain matter that assembles these Freudian self bitch slaps into visual shitstorm stories. 
Ask me in my sleep if expect to be a scientist 24 hours a day and 7 days a week and my reptilian coward of a subconscious will answer in a slinking way, "Yes."
But why is that bad?
If I want to be a scientist, why wouldn't I want to be it all the time?
I guess you have to ask what happens when, as a matter of employment, you have to be the thing you want to be in the way your being paid to be it.
Maybe you stop loving who you are.
Maybe "the fuckers" should stop ruining the dreams of otherwise impassioned and productive people.
Maybe "the fucked" should stop bitching and wake up to an early morning cup of reality, and get on with the selling at least part of their waking reality for a wage and tenuous position under a fucker.

Moving on, and more interesting than the necklace, was its length. It as was already too small for me. 
Because this was a dream and in dreams, we make nonsensical decisions that seem sensical at the time or, at least go unquestioned while dreaming, the Piercing Pagoda pawn and I decided that the necklace should be shortened. 
This made the necklace fit a like a two-inch wide golden choker. 
Next thing I remember was the attachment phase.

The only thing I saw was me seeing how the necklace was being attached to my neck. 
I was looking at my neck from the perspective of someone else because the perspective would otherwise require my eyeballs to be positioned at my throat and to protrude like those of a shrimp. The entire remainder of the dream was a picture of large gauge needle being repeatedly pushed and pulled through a single hole in my neck.
There's no way my mind said itself, "Hey, this is cool. Let's just loop this bit."
If you ask me, and I've never heard this sort of interpretation for why a dreamer's unconscious brain entertains masichistic visions, but if you ask me, it's the person's mind in the midst of stutter.
Trapped in stutter-shock of what's happening to it, the brain just loops in shock and confusion, unable to move on to something that's not traumatic. But, moving on.
 
I was seeing this damn fire poker of a needle exit and reenter from the front at a rate of a medium speed sewing machine.
Despite the illusion of getting a necklace fitted and even sewn on, this repeated piercing was all that was being done. 
According to the jeweler, this was done to enlarge the hole.
Even more odd was that I wasn't bleeding. 
In fact, the scene looked more like the picture of someone running a large needle through a piece of raw chicken.

Funniest of all though, was that this didn't seem like a nightmare when I was experiencing it. 
The voice of the jeweler was actually a sweet rendition of Brenda, a beautiful Mexican-American ex-girlfriend of mine who was ten times as nice and had four times the sense of humor as me. 
She was probably 40 forty times more likely to live longer.
